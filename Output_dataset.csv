Iran reported its single biggest jump in deaths from the new coronavirus on Wednesday, saying that another 147 had died in a nearly 15% spike that raises the death toll to 1,135 people nationwide, the Associated Press reports:
It marks the biggest 24-hour rise in deaths since officials first acknowledged cases of the virus in Iran in mid-February.
The rise in deaths comes as the number of cases continues to grow each day, with some 17,361 people having been infection nationwide, according to a briefing Wednesday by Irans deputy health minister, Alireza Raisi.
The outbreak has cast a shadow over the Persian New Year, Nowruz, a normally joyous holiday that begins on Friday. Health officials have urged the public to avoid travel and crowded places. But many seem to be ignoring the warnings, raising the risk of further outbreaks.

Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, has asked the country’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to stop illegal trading and consumption of wildlife over fears it spreads disease. 
Here is an extract:
The directive, seen as a victory for animal rights organisations, will lead to a clamping down on street-side markets dotted across the country, increase prosecutions of online traders and ideally put pressure on thousands of farms with known links to illegal wildlife trading.
Vitenam’s move to ban the wildlife trade follows similar moves by the Chinese government, after the new coronavirus pandemic appeared to have emerged from a wet market in Wuhan.

EasyJet has put all its flights for autumn and next winter on sale early – for a flat fare of £29.99 – even during Christmas and school holiday peaks, writes the Guardian’s transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham.
The airline said the move will give more scope to passengers who had booked flights for the next couple of months to find alternatives, without any charges to change existing bookings (or to rebook should the crisis persist).
The extraordinary step could provide particularly good deals for people booking in the next week for peak season – and perhaps a glimmer of optimism for some normality ahead.
EasyJet will hope it generates some revenues and forward bookings at a time when demand has vanished and airlines await details of the chancellor’s promised package of help, with the industry warning that most airlines worldwide could go bankrupt by the end of May.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has defended his government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Associated Press reports. 
The Iranian government has faced widespread criticism that officials acted too slowly and may have even covered up initial cases before infections rapidly spread across the country.
AP reports:
Iran has been the hardest hit country in the region, with nearly 1,000 dead and roughly 90% of the over 18,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the Middle East. Its leadership announced Tuesday that millions could die in the Islamic Republic if people keep traveling and ignore health guidance.
In a speech to his Cabinet, Rouhani said the government was straightforward” with the nation, saying it announced the outbreak as soon as it learned about it on Feb. 19. “We spoke to people in a honest way. We had no delay, he added.
The government has come under heavy criticism for what has been seen as a slow and inadequate response. For weeks, government officials implored clerics to shut down crowded holy shrines to stymie the spread of the virus. The government finally closed the shrines this week.
“It was difficult of course to shut down mosques and holy sites, but we did it. It was a religious duty to do it”, Rouhani said.
The outbreak has cast a shadow over the Persian New Year, Nowruz, a normally joyous holiday that begins on Friday. Health officials have urged the public to avoid travel and crowded places. But many seem to be ignoring the warnings, raising the risk of further outbreaks. 
Some food markets in the capital, Tehran, were still packed on Wednesday, and highways were crowded with traffic as families traveled between cities. Iran also announced it would close mosques for communal Friday prayers for a third consecutive week. Other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have also cancelled Friday prayers in mosques.

Bangladesh has reported its first death from the novel coronavirus while 14 patients are infected with the disease across the country, according to officials. 
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora told reporters at a press briefing in Dhaka today, tbs news reported. 
“The elderly victim was suffering from many old age complications and came into contact with a returnee from abroad,” she added.
Flora also said four new coronavirus patients, including one female and three male, were indentified in the country in the last 24 hours.

Estonia and Latvia have pledged to send ships to bring home hundreds of their citizens stranded on the German-Polish border, after Poland closed its borders last week to prevent the spread of coronavirus, writes my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels.

Citing official sources, Reuters said the countries were organising cruise ships and ferries to bring their citizens home via Baltic ports later on Wednesday and next week. The Lithuanian government estimates that 420 vehicles with Lithuanian number plates were stuck at the German-Polish border on Monday. 
Under EU law, countries are allowed to introduce border controls during emergency situations, but are obliged to allow their own citizens to enter and citizens of other EU countries to pass through on their way home. 
Following talks with 27 EU leaders via video link on Tuesday, the head of the European commission Ursula von der Leyen said it was “absolutely crucial that we unblock the situation, because we know that too many people are stranded within the European Union”.
As lorries queue at the EU’s internal borders, prompting concern about the supply of food and medical goods, von der Leyen also urged states to follow new guidelines to ensure the swift flow of supplies.
The flow of goods has to be swift. We need these goods for the functioning of the internal market. 
She was speaking after EU leaders approved a ban on non-EU citizens coming into the union. EU member states will now have to enforce the 30-day ban, which includes exemptions for British nationals, EU citizens and family members returning home, healthcare workers and researchers, diplomats and people transporting goods.

Two UN agencies have announced that refugees will no longer be resettled to homes in safe countries, as the world battles the Covid-19 crisis, writes my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels.
Two UN agencies are suspending refugee resettlement as ""a temporary measure"" because of Covid-19Meanwhile NGOs warn that support services for refugees are closing, volunteer numbers falling - via @lorenzo_tondo https://t.co/LJ7Rv1LttY
In a joint statement, the UN refugee agency (the UNHCR) and the UN migration agency (the IOM), said refugee resettlement would be suspended as “a temporary measure that will be in place only for as long as it remains essential”.
As more countries have introduced travel restrictions and frozen refugee resettlement programmes, the two agencies had little choice. They also raised concern that international travel could increase the exposure of refugees to the virus.
In 2019, the UNHCR helped more than 63,600 refugees find a life in a new country, including people who had fled Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Somalia. In the previous year, the IOM helped nearly 95,000 people find a new home, whether through a resettlement programme to a safe country, or some other humanitarian scheme.
The decision comes after rights groups warned that refugees and migrants - especially unaccompanied minors - need urgent help. The charities are deeply concerned about the fate of 36,000 asylum seekers on five Greek islands, who are sheltering in squalid, overcrowded camps, often lacking electricity, heating and hot water.

Belgium is the latest country to go into lockdown, with citizens asked to stay at home and limit contact to their closest family, writes Jennifer Rankin. 
From noon local time (CET), all non-essential shops and open-air markets will close and people will be expected to work at home. 
Employers who require staff to be on site but cannot ensure social distancing face fines and even closure.
The measures are similar to those adopted by France24 hours earlier, but looser. People will be able to visit supermarkets, pharmacies, medical professionals, banks, post offices and bookshops.
Supermarkets must limit the number of customers to one per 10 square metres, meaning people are likely to have to queue outside, where they must also observe social distancing by standing well apart. 
Going out for a walk or a run, or riding a bike is allowed, “even encouraged”, the authorities say, as long as people observe a distance of one and a half metres from anyone who is not a member of their household.
The restrictions, which are unprecedented in peacetime, were agreed on Tuesday night by Belgium’s national security council, which includes the prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, deputy prime ministers, other senior politicians and the security services.

Wilmès, appointed by the king on Monday to form a permanent government, after 15 months of caretaker administrations, said social distancing did not have to mean no social contact, stressing the role technology could play to keep people together.
She said:
These decisions were not taken lightly and were taken because we are obliged to by the evolving situation. Success in our struggle against Covid-19 is inextricably linked to the efforts of each person.
Belgium has had 1,085 cases of Covid-19 and 10 people have died, according to the latest figures in Belgian media.

Thousands of Australians have been left stranded overseas as airlines cancel flights and countries across the globe shut their borders entirely in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19.
Australians caught by closed borders, airport shutdowns, cancelled flights or soaring ticket prices say they are trying to heed the government’s advice to return home for the duration of the pandemic, but can’t.
At least 100 Australians are isolated in Peru after the government in Lima closed all borders and land crossings and stopped international flights in and out.
Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) has advised all Australians to return home as soon as possible on commercial flights, but has conceded that for some getting back is currently impossible.
The Australian embassy in Lima is closed. In a note to Australians in Peru, Dfat said: “Movement is heavily restricted and Peru’s borders are closed. It is not possible to leave at this time.
“If you’re in Peru remain where you are. Follow the instructions of local authorities. Take care to minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.”
Amy Neilson, a Tasmanian doctor currently in Lima, said she was concerned about a lack of government guidance or assistance for stranded Australians. She said that she, along with others in Peru, were compiling a list of Australians in the country.
“I’m advised the Canadian embassy is trying to make a list of people in Peru on lockdown in the state of emergency. Why is Australia not doing this?” 
Neilson said she tried to get out of Peru days ago, but there were no flights available for days ahead.
“I have a flight booked for the 20th [of March] but it is unlikely to go ahead. Reports are that there are army/police at the airport and you can’t get in without a boarding pass. Also reports of people on floors with nowhere to go.
“People have come from the airport as no flights are leaving any more. People are reporting difficulty getting a taxi as movement is legally limited to the shops or doctors.”
Jorga Gec, an architect from Melbourne, told Guardian Australia there wasn’t enough time to get out of Peru.
“We woke up Monday morning to be told Peru were closing the borders at 11pm that day. We had a flight booked at 7am on Tuesday morning and a connecting flight out to Australia from Santiago, but it was too late.
“We spent most of the day at the airport trying to get a flight out. Hopeless – all flights were already booked out. We were hoping Latam [Airlines] would schedule more flights to help get people out, but they were cancelling flights.”
Other travellers in Peru have said their efforts to contact Dfat have failed, and with the embassy closed for 15 days there has been no official advice on what they should do. Some have even been unable to register their presence overseas with Dfat.
The Peruvian government has announced humanitarian charter flights – run by governments seeking to repatriate their citizens – would be available over the next few days. Guardian Australia has asked the office of the foreign minister whether there are plans to do the same for stranded Australians.
Late on Tuesday, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, said: “Transport options will likely become more limited as countries respond to the Covid-19 outbreak and Dfat’s capacity to provide consular help may be limited.”
On Wednesday, the department raised Australia’s travel advisory to its highest level: “regardless of your destination, age or health, our advice is do not travel at this time”.
Guardian Australia has been contacted by dozens of Australians caught overseas: in Kenya, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, the US, UK, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Hungary, even en route to Antarctica, seeking passage home. 
Thirty-six-year-old Michael de Wildt is trying to get from Watamu, north of Mombasa in Kenya, home to Melbourne.
“I feel like the Maze Runner because tomorrow I’m going to run a gauntlet: by taxi from Watamu to Mombasa, flight to Nairobi, flight to Dubai, flight to Melbourne, taxi to self-quarantine! Fingers crossed I remain Covid-19 free. If not and more importantly, I don’t infect others.”
Chris Selman, a 50-year-old engineer from Perth, is in Anchorage, Alaska, which is “about as far from home as it is possible to be”. He has struggled to change his flights, and has had no communication from airlines, spending more than four hours on hold before giving up.
He said the Australian government’s call for citizens to return was “sensible overall, but the suddenness is troubling and will place more strain on travel”.
“It would have been better to slowly ramp up the alert level over a few days. Makes us worried what they know and are not saying about coming border or airline closures and adds to the sense of panic and chaos.”
An Australian teacher in Laos, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was shocked to be told Australians have been advised to return home immediately.
“They say they aren’t going to close the [Australian] borders, but I am deeply suspicious and expect that might be the plan. I don’t think they are exaggerating the danger though, given the way the pandemic and the responses to the pandemic have unfolded around the world in the last few weeks. I am at the stage where I just want to go home and self-isolate for two weeks.”
There are also an estimated 300 Australian citizens and permanent residents, including young children separated from their parents, still in Wuhan, in Hubei province in central China, which was the original source of the virus and the first part of the world locked down. Many of these people, having missed spots on evacuation flights out of Wuhan, now say they feel safer in China, where the spread of the virus has been successfully mitigated."

Other travellers in Peru have said their efforts to contact Dfat have failed, and with the embassy closed for 15 days there has been no official advice on what they should do. Some have even been unable to register their presence overseas with Dfat.
The Peruvian government has announced humanitarian charter flights – run by governments seeking to repatriate their citizens – would be available over the next few days. Guardian Australia has asked the office of the foreign minister whether there are plans to do the same for stranded Australians.
Late on Tuesday, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, said: “Transport options will likely become more limited as countries respond to the Covid-19 outbreak and Dfat’s capacity to provide consular help may be limited.”
On Wednesday, the department raised Australia’s travel advisory to its highest level: “regardless of your destination, age or health, our advice is do not travel at this time”.
Guardian Australia has been contacted by dozens of Australians caught overseas: in Kenya, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, the US, UK, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Hungary, even en route to Antarctica, seeking passage home. 
Thirty-six-year-old Michael de Wildt is trying to get from Watamu, north of Mombasa in Kenya, home to Melbourne.
“I feel like the Maze Runner because tomorrow I’m going to run a gauntlet: by taxi from Watamu to Mombasa, flight to Nairobi, flight to Dubai, flight to Melbourne, taxi to self-quarantine! Fingers crossed I remain Covid-19 free. If not and more importantly, I don’t infect others.”
Chris Selman, a 50-year-old engineer from Perth, is in Anchorage, Alaska, which is “about as far from home as it is possible to be”. He has struggled to change his flights, and has had no communication from airlines, spending more than four hours on hold before giving up.
He said the Australian government’s call for citizens to return was “sensible overall, but the suddenness is troubling and will place more strain on travel”.
“It would have been better to slowly ramp up the alert level over a few days. Makes us worried what they know and are not saying about coming border or airline closures and adds to the sense of panic and chaos.”
An Australian teacher in Laos, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was shocked to be told Australians have been advised to return home immediately.
“They say they aren’t going to close the [Australian] borders, but I am deeply suspicious and expect that might be the plan. I don’t think they are exaggerating the danger though, given the way the pandemic and the responses to the pandemic have unfolded around the world in the last few weeks. I am at the stage where I just want to go home and self-isolate for two weeks.”
There are also an estimated 300 Australian citizens and permanent residents, including young children separated from their parents, still in Wuhan, in Hubei province in central China, which was the original source of the virus and the first part of the world locked down. Many of these people, having missed spots on evacuation flights out of Wuhan, now say they feel safer in China, where the spread of the virus has been successfully mitigated."

Hospitality workers and businesses won’t be able to pay the rent within weeks without urgent action to get money into their pockets, unions and employers warn.
Employer body the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (Cosboa) and the United Workers Union both say hospitality businesses are in crisis and have already started closing and sacking people due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Piling pressure on the Morrison government to move more quickly in fighting the economic effects of the pandemic, both Cosboa and the UWU say laid-off workers need Centrelink benefits to start flowing immediately as rent and mortgage payments loom for households suddenly deprived of casual work and the income that comes along with it.
“With some workers already facing eviction, we could very easily see some of our members sleeping in their cars,” UWU spokeswoman Karma Lord said.
Sole traders also need immediate income support, Cosboa chief executive Peter Strong told Guardian Australia.
“We don’t want to start a panic, but it’s not called a crisis for no reason,” he said.
Economists warned that Australia’s economy was particularly vulnerable to an inevitable global recession due to its highly casualised workforce. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said his government was planning to make “survival” payments to keep virus-ravaged businesses afloat.
Australia’s sharemarket dived again on Wednesday, falling 6.43% and wiping out gains made on Tuesday.
Lord said the union was “hearing all across the hospitality industry that workers’ shifts are slashed, people are losing their jobs and some businesses are already closing”.
She said the new ban on gatherings of more than 100 people would make things even worse.
“We know that 79% of hospitality workers are casual and casuals are the first people on the chopping block and almost invariably, they have nothing to fall back on,” she said.
Unemployed Melbourne hospitality worker Tara Cairnduff, a long-time member of UWU division Hospo Voice, said laid-off workers were using a template she had created to write to their landlords and ask for a delay in paying the rent.
She said she was also working on a version for hospitality operators to send to commercial landlords.
“Heaps and heaps of people have needed to use it and used it and spread it around,” she said.
She said that on Facebook hospitality support pages “there are thousands and thousands of people closing their businesses”.
She said rent and mortgage payments needed to be dramatically cut or frozen during the crisis to prevent people being tipped on to the street, and Centrelink needed to dramatically improve its service levels.
Strong said the agency needed to be able to get money into people’s bank accounts “within a week or two” of them making an application.
Cosboa, like most employer bodies, also supports raising the Newstart rate by $95 a week.
Services Australia, which runs Centrelink, did not answer Guardian Australia’s questions about waiting and processing times.
“We are expecting an increase in members of the community seeking assistance from us during this time and we are prepared to respond accordingly,” spokesman Hank Jongen said.
Analysts at investment bank UBS say retail landlords will probably have to give rent holidays, which will put most pressure on debt-laden shopping centre operators Vicinity and Scentre.
Strong predicted the savage cuts to flights announced by Qantas and Virgin Australia over the past few days would also cost more jobs.
“You’re going to have people in the supply chain to the airlines, cleaners and caterers.
“They’re going to go under if they have no other business.”
As the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic emptied city streets, the Victorian premier said he would soon detail a “survival package” including cash handouts for businesses crushed by government bans on mass gatherings, a dive in restaurant bookings, closed city office towers and other effects of the crisis.
“We have many businesses who have zero income,” Andrews said.
“Offering them a tax cut doesn’t necessarily do it. If we are going to have some businesses close their doors, if we want to avoid them collapsing altogether and if we want to make sure they are there at the end of this virus, we need to be providing that sort of emergency capital, that sort of emergency cash.”
In a new report on Wednesday, ratings agency S&P said a recession across the Asia-Pacific was “guaranteed” and recovery would be slower than previously hoped.
Asia-Pacific chief economist Shaun Roache said the Australian economy was “particularly vulnerable” to mass sackings because many people already weren’t working as much as they would like.
“The underemployment problem is likely more acute in the accommodation and catering sectors, which account for over 7% of total employment,” he said.
“Of these jobs, over 60% are part time. While this give employers flexibility in reducing hours, the impact on workers can be brutally swift. In turn, this will hit consumer confidence and household income and spending.”
UBS predicts Australia will fall into recession this year and unemployment will soar from its current rate of 5.2% to as much as 8%."

Medical authorities in China have said a drug used in Japan to treat new strains of influenza appeared to be effective in coronavirus patients, Japanese media said on Wednesday.
Zhang Xinmin, an official at China’s science and technology ministry, said favipiravir, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm, had produced encouraging outcomes in clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen involving 340 patients.
“It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,” Zhang told reporters on Tuesday.
Patients who were given the medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virus after a median of four days after becoming positive, compared with a median of 11 days for those who were not treated with the drug, public broadcaster NHK said.
In addition, X-rays confirmed improvements in lung condition in about 91% of the patients who were treated with favipiravir, compared to 62% or those without the drug.
Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, which developed the drug – also known as Avigan – in 2014, has declined to comment on the claims.
Shares in the firm surged on Wednesday following Zhang’s comments, closing the morning up 14.7% at 5,207 yen, having briefly hit their daily limit high of 5,238 yen.
Doctors in Japan are using the same drug in clinical studies on coronavirus patients with mild to moderate symptoms, hoping it will prevent the virus from multiplying in patients.
But a Japanese health ministry source suggested the drug was not as effective in people with more severe symptoms. “We’ve given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn’t seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,” the source told the Mainichi Shimbun.
The same limitations had been identified in studies involving coronavirus patients using a combination of the HIV antiretrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir, the source added.
In 2016, the Japanese government supplied favipiravir as an emergency aid to counter the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea.
Favipiravir would need government approval for full-scale use on Covid-19 patients, since it was originally intended to treat flu.
A health official told the Mainichi the drug could be approved as early as May. “But if the results of clinical research are delayed, approval could also be delayed.”"

Covid-19: South Koreans keep calm and carry on testing
",Nemo Kim in Seoul,"Nation appears to be weathering coronavirus storm well with little sign of panic among public

Covid-19 testing tents are one of the few signs of activity on Seoul’s streets these days. While the number of new confirmed cases across South Korea has stayed below 100 for three days in a row, these makeshift testing centres are spearheading efforts to contain new and worrying clusters of the virus.
Outside the Koreana Building, where an insurance company call centre has produced the capital’s biggest number of infections, medical staff in protective gear work quickly, occasionally pausing to remind people queuing outside not to stand too close to each other.
No one complains about the wait, with one young man offering to change places with an older woman standing several places behind him.
Now and then, gasps can be heard from inside the tent, as another person reacts with surprise at having a swab inserted into their nostrils.
In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed in other virus-hit countries, South Koreans are, for the most part, staying calm. There have been no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing are either waiting to be tested or to buy face masks.
Since South Korea confirmed its first case of the virus on 20 January, health authorities have turned to technology, testing and social distancing in an attempt to contain the outbreak. The WHO this week urged all countries to test aggressively, citing South Korea and Taiwan’s success at limiting coronavirus infections.
But authorities remain on high alert amid new clusters of infections. A new outbreak emerged at a nursing home in the hardest-hit city of Daegu this week, with 74 positive cases, and another 55 were tied to a church south of Seoul.
The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to reassure a nervous public with daily briefings to explain how the virus has spread in the past 24 hours and what measures have been taken in response. It is, many people agree, a welcome show of transparency in uncertain times.
The practice of sending smartphone alerts informing people of an infected person’s previous movements has sparked concerns about personal privacy, however, with the Korean human rights commission advising health authorities to withhold personal information unless it is essential to containing the virus.
Technology and testing aside, some have attributed South Korea’s success in slowing the spread to avoiding minpye - causing trouble to others. That is thought to have been behind the decision by the leaders of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and River of Grace Church to apologise – albeit belatedly – for their followers’ role in spreading the virus during the early stage of the outbreak.
By retracing how someone came to be infected, South Korean authorities have been able to give the public details about new infections and identify infection clusters early on.
After an employee at the call centre tested positive, authorities quickly set up a tent to test everyone who worked or lived in the Koreana Building, as well those had visited the premises.
South Korea has tested more than 250,000 people since the outbreak began, and has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day. It has conducted 3,692 tests per million people, compared with five per million in the US.
South Korea has also pioneered “drive-thru” tests, which allow people to be tested without leaving their vehicles – a system that also means health workers do not have to disinfect the premises after each test.
One hospital in Seoul has gone a step further, developing a “walk-thru” test in which people sit inside a transparent cubicle while a medical worker collects a sample, using gloves attached to the front panel. This approach speeds up the testing process and minimises the risk to medical staff.
If a doctor suspects someone needs to be tested – if they have recently returned from China, had contact with someone known to be infected or belong to an at-risk group, for example – the procedure is done free of charge.
People who do not belong to those categories but wish to be tested are charged 160,000 won (£105) and reimbursed if the result is positive, with the government footing the bill for any treatment they receive.
In addition, people who are self-isolating, including those who have yet to test positive, each receive 454,900 won a month to cover basic living expenses.
While the government has won praise for its transparency, infected people are afraid of being stigmatised.
Ambulance drivers sent to collect people in isolation who then test positive do not switch on their sirens and park a discreet distance from their homes, so as not to alarm other residents.
“They are victims of an illness, and anyone can get infected, but some people will become alarmed if they hear the siren and discover that we’re there to collect a coronavirus patient,” Young-woo Lee, a paramedic, told the Guardian. “Some infected people have apologised to us all the way to the hospital for causing trouble.”
South Korea’s response to Covid-19 has not been seamless, however.
The health and welfare minister, Park Neung-hoo, was accused of ignoring advice on social distancing by holding a meeting of the heads of large hospitals at a restaurant in Seoul last week.
Park, who was photographed without a mask and shaking hands with 23 hospital directors, is now in self-isolation, along with seven other ministry officials, after one of the attendees was found to be infected.
“What is the point of ordinary citizens trying our best when government officials are meeting in restaurants without masks and shaking hands?” said Seoul resident Seung-Jin park, as he queued up outside a pharmacy to buy masks, purchases of which are now limited to two per week per person. “Do they have noodles for brains?”"

So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell

Calla Wahlquist","The stream of continuously updated coronavirus advice can be confusing. Here are some answers to your key questions


Wed 18 Mar 2020 03.21 GMT


First published on Mon 9 Mar 2020 06.41 GMT


Australian health authorities have provided a stream of continuously updated advice about the coronavirus, and it can be confusing to navigate. We have distilled some of that advice here to help answer your key questions.
According to the World Health Organization, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
The Australian government also warns that people with suppressed immune symptoms, such as cancer patients, are at elevated risk. So, too, are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people in detention, and people in group residential settings like aged care homes face an elevated risk.
First, you should read the Australian government health advice, which is updated daily, and the advice of your local state and territory health department (contacts here). The Australian health department has compiled a list of resources here for medical professionals and members of the community.
The advice from state and territory health authorities is that if you develop a fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath within 14 days of any overseas travel or contact with a confirmed case you should contact your doctor. You are also asked to contact your doctor and request a test if you have pneumonia, even if you have not travelled or had known contact.
As of 16 March, all returned travellers to Australia, from every country, are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Penalties apply if this quarantine is breached.
Australia’s chief health officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, has repeatedly requested that people do not attempt to get a test for Covid-19 unless they are a returned traveller, have had contact with a confirmed or suspected case, or have pneumonia. This is to ensure testing of the most at-risk cases can be done quickly.
On 13 March, Murphy sent a letter to GPs warning that coronavirus testing kits as well as supplies of protective equipment were “deteriorating rapidly” and to prioritise cases that meet the key testing criteria.
The New South Wales chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said that testing of people who have recently returned from overseas was one of the best ways to slow the progress of the infection.
On 18 March Australia raised its travel advice to a level four for the whole world, the first time this has ever happened in Australia’s history. Australians who are abroad and wish to return home have been urged to do so immediately.
“The travel advice to every Australian is ‘Do not travel abroad’,” prime minister Scott Morrison said.
People who are unwell and have recently been overseas are advised to contact their GP or, for more serious illness, attend hospital. In both cases you are advised to phone ahead and tell them you suspect you may have the coronavirus. If a hospital near you has a fever clinic, go there rather than the general emergency ward. You can locate them by calling your state or territory health department. The numbers are below.
First, if you are unwell in any way, do not go to work or school. Do not send unwell children to school. It is still more likely, if you have cold-like symptoms, that it’s just an ordinary cold, but it’s best to be extremely cautious. By reducing the rate of general sickness in the community, we reduce the overall load on doctors and hospitals.
If you have not been overseas, and have not had known contact with someone who has recently returned from overseas or has been confirmed to have Covid-19, then on current medical advice there is no reason to get tested for Covid-19.
Rates of confirmed community transmission in Australia remain low, as of 18 March. The first recorded instance was a cluster in northern Sydney associated with an aged care home, where three elderly residents have died after testing positive.
Murphy said there was no need for people to get tested, or seek medical advice, unless they are a returned traveller, or have had close contact with a confirmed case. We’re going into the flu season – people will have symptoms that are just the ordinary cold.
That advice may change if the rate of community transmission in Australia grows.
There have been several national roundtables with the aged care and primary care sectors. But some GPs have reported that they do not feel equipped to respond to this crisis.
The advice from authorities is for people who suspect they may have Covid-19, but are not severely unwell, to get tested by their GP to keep the pressure off emergency departments. But if your GP tells you they are not equipped to help, contact the health department in your state or territory and ask if there are any specialist fever clinics near you.
The Australian government has also committed $100m toward creating a Medicare item number for telehealth services, to allow doctors to triage or treat people with milder symptoms, or vulnerable people, remotely. 
Anyone returning to Australia from overseas must self-isolate for 14 days. Penalties apply if this quarantine is breached.You are also required to self-isolate if you have been tested for Covid-19 but do not yet have the results, or if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case.
If you are under isolation, you do not go in to work or school or to any outings except to see your medical practitioner. If you need to travel, it’s recommended you use a private car, or follow this advice.
According to the federal government’s advice on home isolation, you can go into your backyard, garden or balcony while isolated but not into public areas. If you live in an apartment, it’s recommended you wear a surgical mask and walk quickly through the common areas. Masks do not protect you from getting the infection, but it lowers the chance that the person wearing the mask will spread it.
The advice on whether you can go for a walk is unclear and may vary state-to-state based on new laws to ensure travellers self-isolate. If you do go for a walk, choose a quiet path at a quiet time of the day, do not interact with anyone and wear a mask.
You cannot receive visitors and only people who are part of the household should be allowed in the home. Ask family or friends who are not in isolation to deliver food and supplies.
Other members of the household are not required to isolate unless you develop the symptoms of the coronavirus, in which case it will be determined on a case-by-case basis by health authorities.
If your infection is confirmed they will be defined as close contacts and be required to isolate with you.
“It doesn’t mean no contact with your family, but we would like you to keep away from your family, at least a metre-and-a-half away,” Murphy said. “If you have to go out for some purpose, generally it is good to wear a face mask and particularly avoid public gatherings.”
Close contact is defined as being face to face with someone for at least 15 minutes, or being in the same enclosed space for at least two hours. 
Authorities recommend the person under isolation stay in different rooms to other family members and use a separate bathroom if available. Wear a surgical mask when in common areas and clean high-contact areas (taps, door handles and benches) daily with a disinfectant or diluted bleach.
Monitor your symptoms and your health throughout the 14-day isolation period. If you are unwell, or your symptoms worsen, report any change to your doctor.
If your child is showing symptoms of a viral respiratory illness and either they or you have recently returned from overseas, or they or you have had close contact with a confirmed case, then seek medical advice and ask if they should be tested for Covid-19.
If they are unwell and considered to be at risk then they should not attend school or public gatherings and should be isolated at home for 14 days. As their parent, you’re a close contact, so if they test positive for the virus you will also have to be isolated at home for 14 days.
As of 18 March, Australia’s chief health officers have not recommended the closure of schools. Some schools have already been closed temporarily after cases were reported, and Murphy said there may be further localised school closures if there were severe outbreaks in particular areas.
Children can catch the virus, but they generally have very mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. It’s a good idea to keep children separate from vulnerable family members, like elderly grandparents, who are at greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. Under new rules for aged care centres, visitors aged under 16 will need special permission because of the risk they could spread the virus.
Older people are the most at risk of a severe illness from Covid-19. Ensure that their treating doctor has all relevant information about high risk co-morbidities so your loved one can be triaged appropriately. Most hospitals have set up isolation wards to care for patients who are severely unwell from Covid-19.
Many aged care homes have placed stricter conditions around visiting because of the Covid-19 outbreak. As of 18 March, visits to aged care homes are also limited by federal rules that ban large group visits, allow visitors by children aged under 16 by exception only, and limit visitors to a maximum of two at one time per day.
Do not visit an aged care home if you are unwell, even if you have not recently returned from overseas – influenza is also a risk to aged care homes.
If your elderly parent or grandparent is well enough to care for themselves, and either has been or is suspected of being exposed to the coronavirus, they will be advised to go into self-isolation. You can help by delivering food and necessities, and by ensuring you wash your hands and practice good hygiene so the virus doesn’t spread. If you are their carer, or have recently visited, you might be a close contact and be required to go into isolation if their infection is confirmed.
If they live with you, you may be required to go into isolation as well depending on whether they are a confirmed case and you have had close contact with them.

Australia's coronavirus self-isolation rules: who has to do it and how it works

From midnight on Sunday 15 March, everyone entering Australia from overseas, except for flight attendants and residents of the Pacific Islands, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Failing to do so risks thousands in fines.
But what does self-isolation actually mean, and can you still Uber home from the airport? We answered your burning questions.
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, indicated that people subject to self-isolation would still be able to take taxis and public transport from airports.
People who need to travel domestically after arriving in Australia will be able to continue their journey, beginning self-isolate when they arrive at their destination, according to Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton.
It’s important to maintain hygiene measures while in transit. Use hand sanitiser and cough into your elbow or into a tissue, and maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other passengers where possible. If you are a recently returned traveller in New South Wales, you must wear a surgical mask while travelling to your home or hotel.
The safest way to get home from the airport is for someone you live with to pick you up. If you have to take an Uber or a taxi, it’s worth sitting in the back seat and keeping a note of the vehicle number or the driver.
Taxi and Uber drivers should be taking extra precautions too, said Chris Moy, the South Australian president of the Australian Medical Association. He recommends drivers use hand sanitiser and disinfectant.
Travellers from the Pacific Islands are who are transiting through Australia are currently exempt from the 14-day self-isolation requirement in both Australia and New Zealand.
This exemption is explicitly mentioned in the Victorian state of emergency declaration.
That is because many Pacific Island nations are only accessible via Australia and New Zealand. There have also been very few cases of Covid-19 in the Pacific.
This depends. If you have been diagnosed with Covid-19, anyone you live with will be classed as a close contact so all of you will need to self-isolate.
If you are only self-isolating as a precaution, for example because you have just returned from overseas, they do not need to self-isolate – but you should stay as far away from them as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible. Ensure everyone in the home washes their hands frequently, and surfaces and doorknobs are frequently wiped with an alcohol-based disinfectant. Try to stay at least 1.5 metres away from the other people in your home. You cannot have visitors.
It’s recommended you stay away from people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus, including elderly relatives, and minimise contact with other people, including children. If you are experiencing symptoms, wear a mask or a makeshift mask.
Moy said that people needing to look after children or parents while in self-isolation should maintain good hygiene practices and minimise contact. Try to keep a 1.5-metre distance when possible, wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, and disinfect surfaces.
“To expect hard and fast rules is difficult,” he said. “We’re asking for patience, commonsense and probably a level of ingenuity from the public to get us through this.”
Each state and territory has slightly different laws around self-isolating, but if you are under a mandatory order to self-isolate it’s best to avoid going outside for anything but medical appointments and emergencies. Wear a mask when outside.
The Australian government’s health advice recommends exercise DVDs or walking around your backyard.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from Australian National University, says the thing to keep in mind is your proximity to other people – which means a walk alone, at a quiet time of day, should be fine.
The situation may be different if you are under a legislative order, in which case you will have to abide by the rules set down in each state.
If you are self-isolating because you have returned from overseas or have had contact with a known case, and you begin to notice respiratory symptoms (particularly fever, shortness of breath or a cough), contact your state or territory health department, your GP or the emergency clinic of your local hospital. Call before attending your GP or hospital to warn them you may have the virus.
If you have severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, call triple zero.
You will not be able to get a test unless you fit certain high-risk criteria and have respiratory symptoms. The Australian government is not testing asymptomatic people and at this stage testing remains restricted to people returning from overseas and known contacts of confirmed cases. If you have symptoms of pneumonia you will be tested regardless of travel or contact history.
Ask a neighbour, family member or friend to deliver groceries to you. These should be left outside your door. The same goes for grocery deliveries and takeaway food.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said government care packages will be made available to people in that state . “In the event, through no fault of your own, you’ve found yourself at home without the basics, we will get those basics to you,” he said.
Some community groups are also organising to provide food and supplies to people in isolation. If you have a neighbourhood Facebook group, check with them.
People who arrived in Australia before the mandatory 14-day self-isolation began at 12.01am on 16 March are not legally required to self-isolate, but they should still exercise caution.
The incubation period for Covid-19 is between five and 10 days. That means if you returned from overseas in the past two weeks, particularly from countries with a high rate of spread, such as the US, you should be engaging in social distancing, and monitoring yourself for any symptoms.
Collignon says the higher your risk of experiencing complications from the virus, the more distancing and hygiene measures you should be putting in place.
“For people in the high-risk group, particularly people over 70, once we get a lot of transmission in society, relative self-isolation is a good idea,” he said.
“You don’t become a hermit, but you limit your contact to people who are well, and to fewer people.”
The rate at which people should be increasing their isolation should rise with the spread of the disease, Collignon says. So while a healthy 50-year-old person may be social distancing now, once the weather cools in winter and the spread of the virus increases throughout the community, they may need to self-isolate.
Self-isolation for 14 days is mandatory for anyone who arrived in Australia after 12.01am, 16 March and financial penalties apply.

","For some, workplaces are hotspots. For the over-65s, it’s shops and restaurants. We urgently need to change our behaviour
Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.
Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for diseases like Sars, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness – it is easy to recognise people who are infected.
In the case of Covid-19, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why airport screening at arrival is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, containment has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.
So how does an epidemic spread through a population – and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as R), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.
The larger the value of R, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to 1.4 new infections. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the early stages of an outbreak. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.
In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce R below 1. For diseases such as measles, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on R. For R of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for R of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get R below 1.
However, an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.
Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.
Another option to reduce the duration of infection is continued testing; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).
If we can’t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds with hot water and soap, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick – all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.
Cancelling large gatherings, working from home and school closures are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.
But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called BBC Pandemic, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.
What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 – who are particularly at risk from severe Covid-19 illness – make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.
Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number R, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.
We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it. Starting now, and for the duration of this epidemic, we all have a role to play and a responsibility to modify our behaviour in order to protect the ones who are most at risk.

What effect will winter have on coronavirus in Australia?

Graham Readfearn","As the southern hemisphere winter looms, cooler temperatures may affect the behaviour of the virus – and of people, who tend to spend more time close together indoors


Tue 17 Mar 2020 03.12 GMT


Last modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 10.54 GMT


In many parts of the world, wintertime tends to be when people get sick from viruses that cause colds and influenza.
The illness Covid-19 broke out in China’s winter and spread in Iran, Italy and the rest of Europe as those countries endured their coldest months.
As Australia heads into winter, what could this mean for the spread of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes the Covid-19 illness?
Experts have told Guardian Australia that cooler temperatures can affect the behaviour and spread of a virus in three interconnected ways.
Firstly, temperatures can affect the virus directly.
Some viruses may have a temperature range where they can survive for longer and this is partly dependent on their “envelope” – the outer layer that’s made of lipids (which is why washing hands with soap is effective, because it disrupts the lipids).
Secondly, when temperatures drop, this changes the behaviour of the human population. People tend to spend more time indoors and in closer contact, making it easier for the virus to spread.
Thirdly, we already know that like in other parts of the world, winter in Australia is when other viruses circulate and this can affect the immunity of populations.
Associate Prof Tom Kotsimbos of Monash University, who is also a respiratory physician at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, says seasonality can cause an increase in the spread of viruses.
“That is well established, but whether we understand that deeply is another thing. It does have an influence, but we don’t understand it specifically. This is a new virus, and that does not mean it will be like the others.
“We know it’s about the biology of the virus, the general and specific immunity of us and the environmental and behavioural conditions,” he says.
But there is much less certainty, he says, about how important each factor is when it comes if a person gets sick.
“It’s interesting that [Covid-19] has spread all over the world quite quickly – both north and south,” he said, adding that this suggested either the new virus was not dependent on temperature or that this dependency was not as important as the lack of immunity in the population that was helping it to spread.
Some studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed have tried to find out if there is a clear link between temperature and the rate of infection of the coronavirus, but have been inconclusive or contradictory.
Dr Meru Sheel of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at Australian National University, says: “There is no clear evidence to suggest a relationship between outdoor temperatures and spread of coronaviruses.
“We don’t know enough about Sars-CoV-2 yet to know how change in weather will affect outbreak and the disease epidemiology.
“In some tropical countries such as Pacific Island countries, despite the warm weather, there is some seasonal influenza activity and it is related to increase in travellers from countries such as Australia and New Zealand and to a much lesser extent related to change in weather.”
Sheel said studies are under way investigating the duration of the survival of Sars-CoV-2 under different conditions and on different surfaces.
“Evidence from these studies is likely to improve our understanding of the disease transmission pathways and improve our response strategy.
“However until we know more, we need to ensure that all surfaces are decontaminated using disinfectants such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, bleach etc – based on local infection, prevention and control guidelines.”
Sheel pointed to a review of research into other known human coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers, that found the viruses survived for varying lengths of time.
The study found they could be infectious on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, metal, wood and paper for up to nine days, but disinfectant cleaning was effective.
Sheel says rather than the temperature itself, the change in the way Covid-19 spreads “is likely influenced by frequency at which people interact during cooler versus warmer weather”.
Dr Chris Burrell, emeritus professor of virology of the University of Adelaide, said there were other known coronaviruses that had been around for half a century and these were also prevalent in winter.
“But that’s because of people congregating together,” he said.
He said one example of this effect was with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that causes a common respiratory disease in young children that tends to arrive in winter.
Burrell says: “If you think of children in preschool, in the summer they’re out in the sun and don’t have a lot of personal contact with each other. In winter, they’re inside and breathing the same air.
“I think that any effect of temperature on coronavirus won’t be nearly as important as the effect of limiting its spread by isolating people.”
Ten years ago Tom Kotsimbos led a taskforce of respiratory specialists that looked at what impact a potential early winter arrival of swine flu could have on Australia’s population.
He said the same questions that were being asked then – about the influence of temperature and the overlap with Australia’s flu season – are being asked again now.
“Clearly this is a different virus – but we have been here before ... but we don’t know how Covid-19 will behave.
“On an individual level, if you get a virus when your defences are already down from a recent viral infection, then that could be increasingly challenging with the progression of the disease.
“Previous studies have suggested that if you have recently recovered from a viral infection then your innate immune systems may actually be bolstered and that might help with subsequent attacks.”
He said adding the impacts of Covid-19 on top of flu season “will put an incredible stress on the healthcare system”.
Dr Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said: “My concern is that [in winter] people tend to be in closer contact and it coincides with our flu season.
“My main concern is that when you think of the healthcare system, that does get pushed in a bad flu season. If we combine a moderate flu season with a moderate coronavirus season, that could be problematic.”
Sheel said: “As Australia moves into cooler weather, we are likely to see an increase in respiratory diseases such as common colds, influenza and RSV infections.
“To minimise the pressure on the health system it will be important for the community to adopt public health prevention measures, get vaccinated and staying at home when unwell – practising social distancing.
“This will also help improve our ability to test for Covid-19 and in return protect our vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions and minimise their risk of exposure to infection with Covid-19. All these factors will contribute towards better control of the outbreak.”"

I’ll be posting some links to reaction around the media to Biden’s primary victories shortly, but it is not just election politics that is being affected by coronavirus. Day-to-day on Capitol Hill is going to change too.
The Associated Press are reporting this morning on how Congressional leaders are resisting calls to let lawmakers vote remotely, with it being described as a dispute which is pitting coronavirus against two centuries of tradition.
Advocates of the voting change cite the health perils of air travel at a time when health experts want people to avoid crowds. They argue that as infections spread, it may become all but impossible for many lawmakers to make the journey because of the growing risk of getting the virus.
“There was a time when physical presence was the only way to make sure that a person was present and voting,” No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin said on Tuesday. “I think that technology gives us other options and we better exercise them.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not having it. “We’ll not be doing that,” McConnell he told reporters. He suggested his chamber might extend roll call votes beyond the traditional 15 minutes and allow senators to vote in small groups, rather than all at once. “We will deal with the social distancing issue without fundamentally changing Senate rules,” McConnell said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose hometown of San Francisco is among many Bay Area communities whose residents have been ordered to stay home, has also opposed the idea, according to lawmakers who’ve spoken to her.
Whether these objections continue to be sustainable if the coronavirus crisis lasts for several months remains to be seen.

US Surgeon General Jerome Adams has been on the TV this morning. Challenged on whether people are getting the administration’s message, he said: “I think we are starting to turn a corner and people really are, because it is starting to affect people who they see or know.”
He joked that his sons at home don’t care what dad says about staying home, even if their dad is the surgeon general, but “by golly they know that Kevin Durant just got diagnosed with the coronavirus”

The global pandemic is straining ties between the United States and China further. Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:
Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus” or the “Chinese virus” on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.
On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus”, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.
In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.
“And this all started in China? That’s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?” Trump asked.
“Absolutely,” Sorenson replied.
“Hopefully, you all heard that,” Trump told reporters.
Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western Xinjiang Province, the Chinese have taken particular offence to the constant repetition, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the US military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.
“Recently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China. We express strong indignation and opposition to it,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. “We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against China.”
That, in turn, has prompted angry US protests with the State Department hauling in China’s ambassador to the United States to complain and Pompeo calling the top Chinese diplomat to re-register the anger.
“The disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,” Pompeo said, before quickly adding that “now is not the time for recriminations.”
Yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day.
“China was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them,” Trump said. “That was false. And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it’s a very accurate term. But no, I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.”
Shortly after Trump’s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. 
Pompeo responded to that news: “I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times. Where more information, more transparency are what will save lives. This is unfortunate,” he said. “I hope they will reconsider.”

Another thing we can expect today is further fall-out from the Chinese decision yesterday to expel American journalists. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been “compelled” to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.
“We urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,” Geng said. “China is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.”
At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.

Good morning. Last night Joe Biden swept to victory in three primaries held in unprecedented circumstances. Biden has now racked up 1,147 pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders’ 861 - a lead of 286 that surely looks to be insurmountable. Is it time for Bernie to quit the race in the interest of unifying the party during a national emergency?
Ohio cancelled its primary planned for yesterday due to the coronavirus. But with Florida, Illinois and Arizona running their primaries yesterday, predictably voters faced confusion, a shortage of poll workers, and shifting or closed polling stations. It’s clear that the way the rest of the campaign is going to be deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The DNC is already urging a shift to vote-by-mail.
In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the @DNC are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.
With bars, shops, and restaurants ordered shut across parts of the nation, it is impossible to see politics being business-as-usual for some time to come.
Yesterday Donald Trump was proclaiming that he knew it was a pandemic all along - just weeks after the president promised that the 15 cases of coronavirus in the US would soon go down to zero. There’s currently - as recorded by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering - 6,496 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, and the death toll has now exceeded 100. 
It is understandably dominating today’s White House agenda. Trump has calls and meetings with the aerospace industry, physicians, nurses, and a quarterly business roundtable. The Coronavirus Task Force will be doing a morning briefing.
We’ll be tracking the responses to Biden’s win last night and political developments around the country here. There’s also our rolling live coverage of the global coronavirus outbreak over here with my colleague Alexandra Topping in London."

What’s quarantine without a fun way to pass the time? As pandemic-induced social distancing pushes more and more people to the solitude of the home, self-isolators have started coming up with ways to entertain themselves, their neighbours and strangers around the world through social media.
For cinemagoers who miss the collective experience of the silver screen – the phones bleeping in quiet scenes, that guy behind you munching popcorn in your ear and, perhaps more particularly, the delight of dissecting the film with friends afterwards – the UK actor Brett Goldstein has started up a film club on Twitter.
Under the hashtag #IsolationFilmClub, a movie is selected every day by a nominated user, “anyone who wants to watch it can, and then talk about it using the hashtag”, Goldstein said.
Since lots of people will be stuck at home, I’ve decided to start a film club. Every day we pick a film. Anyone who wants to watch it can, and then talk about it using the hashtag #isolationfilmclub First film is Long Shot.I nominate @MrNishKumar to choose tomorrow’s. pic.twitter.com/IdSosVibhq
For those who want something a bit more active, there’s Big Kitchen Disco: a collaborative playlist coupled with a simultaneously solo household kitchen boogie, which kicked off with – naturally – Dancing On My Own by Robyn.
It’s Mardi Gras meets the Italian balcony musicians.
OK so the idea is this. We can't go out, so let's all meet at 7pm in YOUR kitchen and have a dance. Send your suggestions and we'll pick one for each night, and add it to the Big Kitchen Disco playlist https://t.co/5Vwv0qhc0T
Or you could dance along to one of the many quarantine playlists being created. The actor Rita Wilson – who was diagnosed with coronavirus along with her husband Tom Hanks on Australia’s Gold Coast last week – collaborated with the public to produce Quarantunes, a 47-song set on Spotify including such classics as Locked Up by Akon, U Can’t Touch This by MC Hammer and I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.
And since you’re dancing, why not couple it with a light show? After Sydney, Australia announced it was cancelling its annual aural and visual festival Vivid – known not just for the colourful light-art displays over landmarks throughout the CBD, but its live concert series – a DIY version has sprung up on Facebook.
“Get your own festive lights out on your balcony, switch over your lounge room bulbs to COLOUR. Get your self isolation pad LIT for our own makeshift DIY Vivid Australia,” the event page says.
Meanwhile over on Instagram, Australian musicians who are part of youth broadcaster Triple J’s emerging music program, Unearthed, have been covering each other’s songs.
Hauskey, the musician who started it, said he started doing it to stave off the feeling of being “useless” while stuck at home. With so many musicians having had gigs cancelled for the foreseeable future, “exposing my small audience to someone else’s music is one tiny way I can help out”, he said.
 It feels *very* odd to promote yourself right now, but the music industry needs a lot of support so maybe it would be cool if local artists promoted other local artists? Here’s @elueramusic’s ‘Good Girl’ with my own little spin. Go stream it! #covered19

For those whose cathartic impulses tend towards the introspective, the Oregon illustrator Carson Ellis has started a Quarantine Art Club on Instagram, posting regular art prompts, challenges and tips in an attempt to help others entertain themselves or the other people in their household – particularly the youngsters.
 WOW. How are you all doing? Today was my kid’s seventh birthday. We were supposed to have a party but that became a dinner at a restaurant which became a dinner at home with a single friend which, in the end, became TOTAL LOCKDOWN when we made the call to isolate completely at home for the next week without friends or playdates. Each time we cancelled the birthday plan and replaced it with something more restrictive and lonely, he fell apart. But then, each time, he collected himself and moved on. He’s a ray of light and fortitude. I’m so lucky to be his mom. I hope all you other Americans are staying home this week as much as you possibly can. By all accounts, this moment is critical. If we’re going to flatten that curve, we need to do it this week and we need to do it by staying away from each other. Please, please, stay home if you have the privilege to do it. Some of us have to go to work. Some of us have to help those in need. But a lot of us can stay in and deprive this virus of more human fodder and it’s our duty to do it. Meanwhile, I’m thinking of ways that we can stay connected here through art. I’ll keep posting drawing prompts on Tuesdays but I’d like to post art assignments more often than that because we’re all going to be more isolated than usual. Many of us just became unwitting homeschool teachers to our kids. Many of us will be home all alone for a while. Let’s keep busy. I’ll try to post assignments every day this week that you can do on your own or with your family. Let me know if you have drawing exercises you love and I’ll share them. Okay! Watch this spot for the first assignment on Monday and stay safe. Check in with your neighbors and wash your hands. ❤️

More than 700 people responded to the first challenge: a self-portrait.
Ellis’s Quarantine Art Club is a more organised, visual art-focused version of the creative projects happening around the world under the hashtag #IsolationCreation, in which art-makers of all kinds are using the enforced downtime to make, bake, carve, collage and concoct their way through the crisis.

How not to panic during the coronavirus pandemic: welcome hard times like a Stoic

People around the world are feeling rudderless and adrift. There’s conflicting information about the pandemic – but it’s not just about health. People losing work, feeling frightened, being isolated at home, worried about their loved ones and wondering about getting basic supplies.
We all must make ethical decisions in this pandemic. Should I take that second pack of toilet paper for my family, or leave it for the next? Should essential workers stay home to protect themselves?
Responses are varied. Some people are showing grace under pressure. Some are responding with shock or panic, others seem to be wilfully ignoring the situation. Many have never experienced this type of crisis before, others are finding their traditional roadmaps breaking down: churches empty, political leaders losing trust, supermarkets ransacked, neighbours “sheltering in place” behind closed doors.
The more we read, the more anxious we become.
Stoicism is an ancient tool for remaining calm in adversity. Often dumbed down to refer to having a stiff upper lip, or emotional reserve, Stoicism is actually a deep philosophical framework, useful in providing an ethical scaffold for both everyday life and in times of difficulty.
Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that was founded by Zeno of Citium, in Athens, in the early 3rd century BC.
Stoics welcomed hard times – they saw their life as training for moments such as the one we are in now, where character, resilience and courage are tested. Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: “The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skilful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.”
He saw crisis as a way of unmasking who you really are: “Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.”
In times like this it’s easy to spiral into anxiety. The Stoics strived for tranquility and believed that our minds are powerful and create their own heaven or hell. Stoics such as the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius lived through the Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, an ancient pandemic that wiped out a third of the population. Philosopher and playwright Seneca had to deal at close range with despots such as Caligula and Nero (who eventually ordered his death), and both Marcus Aurelius and Seneca had to carry on after the death of their children.
A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus
They were calm, focused and courageous in the face of carnage. Seneca said: “We are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in the imagination than reality.”
Stoics prized rational thinking, acting on good information and contemplating the situation fully rather than acting rashly or from a place of panic and anxiety. Marcus Aurelius coped by not allowing his thoughts to be overrun by negativity. “The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make of it,” he wrote in his nightly diary. Those in quarantine in Wuhan also kept a diary as a way of coping.
A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus. Counselled Epictetus: “Other people’s views and troubles can be contagious. Don’t sabotage yourself by unwittingly adopting negative, unproductive attitudes through your associations with others.”
The Stoics believed that humans as social animals were created to support each other. Marcus Aurelius devoted himself to “do good to my fellow creatures and bear with them.”
No plague or injury can do more damage than you do to yourself through acts of bad character. Character is key for the Stoics. They believed that your health and your money can be taken away from you at any time – but no one can take your character from you. So you need to nurture it. It’s particularly important at times of global emergency where we need to pull together.
Demonstrating good character might involve not hoarding scarce goods such as toilet paper. It might mean not taking all the pasta and rice for yourself and leaving none for others. It might mean self-isolating not just for your own protection but to protect others. 
“Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness,” said Seneca.
When people in northern Italy escaped quarantine despite being ordered to do so, they spread the virus across the country, imperilling other communities. They acted out of fear and didn’t consider the wider good when taking action. 
Ancient Stoics recognised humans are highly social animals, and we exist and find meaning within our communities. Their philosophy reflected our deep and profound interconnectedness. According to Seneca, “we are waves of the same sea, leaves of the same tree, flowers of the same garden.”
It was no coincidence that when the Chinese sent boxes of medical supplies and face masks to Italy last week, the crates were all stamped with this quote.
As many of us lock down and go into social isolation to try to contain the spread of the virus, we are fearful about how we might cope for an indefinite period of time away from our friend, pleasures, routines and social life.
The Stoics have a lot to teach us about surviving quarantine – after all, a lot of them were exiled by angry rulers, and faced years trapped in a place and situation not of their choosing.
One of the most important Stoic teachers from ancient Rome, Gaius Musonius Rufus, was exiled to the small and desert-like island of Gyaros (in 65, the same year Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide). Seneca previously was exiled by Claudius to Corsica for eight years, just when his star was on the rise in ancient Rome.
Rather than being bitter at his fall from grace, Seneca used his time in exile to enjoy the natural world and think about the nature of life.
“Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company,” he said.
It also taught him that a bit of deprivation can be an excellent corrective – as you realise in good times you often become habituated to living a soft, decadent life.
In letters to his friend Lucilius, he wrote: “Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realise how unnecessary many things are. We’ve been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.”
When Boris Johnson said last week, “I must level with you, many families, many more families are going to lose loved ones” due to Covid-19, he was (maybe unwittingly) employing the Stoic technique of negative visualisation.
This technique involves thinking about what you value most in life, then imagine losing that thing. It might range from losing a precious piece of jewellery right through to imagining someone you love dying – in this case, dying from the virus.
Negative visualisation was practised by Stoics for a couple of reasons. This includes not only inoculating us to inevitable loss in life, but also enabling us to appreciate the people and things we love. Stoics believed that we are less likely to take someone for granted if we are aware that they may not be in our life forever. We might all be quarantined for quite a while. There are worse uses of your time than reading the Stoics. They have a lot to teach us.

Silver linings: how to stay positive during the coronavirus crisis

These stories are designed to offer practical advice, provide some entertainment, foster a sense of social cohesion, and remind people of the good in the world during these strange and isolating times.
With all the tragic things that are happening in the world as a result of the coronavirus, now might seem like an unusual time to talk about being positive. Yet staying positive is a core ingredient in the recipe of successful coping in a crisis.
Now, more than ever, is the time for us to be proactive about creating small moments of happiness in our days, given the findings in psychology research that positive emotions help us to undo the negative effects of stress.
I’ll come to the research in a minute, but first there are a few really practical things you can do to foster positive emotions.
Savour the small moments: Even during lockdown you still have many small moments to savour. The smell of coffee, the feel of the warm shower on your back and so on. When you stop to take in these moments, rather then let them rush by on automatic pilot, you are giving your brain a chance to process the pleasure, which boosts your serotonin – the feel good neurotransmitter that helps elevate your mood and make you feel calm.
Strengthen your connections: for those of us in family lockdown, now is the opportunity to spend quality time with our loved ones. Take the time to hug your kids or partner, look them in the eyes, have long conversations with them – all of these gestures promote closeness and also boost your oxytocin, which is a hormone that bonds people and also has a calming effect on your body. When your oxytocin levels spike they tell your body to switch off cortisol, the stress hormone.
Look for the good in others: These types of crises can bring out both the worst and the best in human nature. This week there were two Youtube clips that went viral in Australia about toilet paper. One was of three grown women fighting in Woolworths over a packet of toilet paper. The other was two young children dragging a large cart of toilet paper behind them and stopping at the homes of elderly people in their neighbourhood to give them a roll. I like to think that the best in human nature is rising to the coronavirus challenge. Philanthropists are donating money to scientists to find a cure. Doctors and medical staff are working overtime to help sick patients. Neighbourhoods are putting together care packages for people who are sleeping rough. People are posting positive messages on social media. Friends from across the globe reaching out to each other. When we tune into these positive and pro-social aspects of the crisis, we are united in hope.
By tuning into these three silver linings, you can potentially change your brain chemistry and build up your energy stores to help you cope with the other aspects of your day that have been made more difficult.
Taking charge of our mental health and capturing the small moments will help as we go further into the unknown, too. If we can foster positive emotions, the flow-on effects are well researched, and well documented. In fact, positive emotions are a key resource for us during the coronavirus crisis because they can do a number of things:
Increase your resilience: Research has shown that when we experience positive emotions on the back of a stressful event, we bounce back more quickly and have a faster “cardiovascular recovery” time – our heart rate lowers and our blood pressure stabilises more quickly when we are able to be positive.
Increase your immunity: a study where people were deliberately infected with the influenza virus and rhinovirus found that those people who had more positive emotions were more likely to fight off the symptoms. People low on positive emotions were 2.9 times more likely to contract a respiratory illness in this study.
Make you think more clearly: the way we feel influences the way we think. Positive emotions boost our problem solving abilities as well as our judgment, decision-making, cognitive flexibility and creativity. Staying positive will help you and your kids to be better at solving all the little problems that are being thrown our way right now, such as figuring out new technology platforms for working (and schooling) from home.
Every dark cloud has a silver lining and this is your chance to thicken that lining and take charge of your mental health so that you come out of this experience stronger.

The BBC World Service’s 13 Minutes to the Moon is guaranteed to take you to a different time and place from where we’re at right now. And it’s also a reminder of what a determined community inspired by a great leader can do. There were 13 minutes from when the Apollo 11 lunar lander detached from the mother ship to when it landed on the moon’s surface. The podcast takes you through, in detail, those 13 minutes, with original audio, new interviews and archived interviews from many of those who were there. There’s original music, too, from the great Hans Zimmer – and even a bonus episode all about the music.
Start from the beginning! The second series that looks at the doomed Apollo 13 mission is just out. – Graham Readfearn, environment reporter
Was it an urban myth or was it real? Generations of journalists heard the story from rickshaw drivers, fixers, tea-sellers. The story was that in the forest in the city limits of Delhi, cut off from the world, lived a prince, a princess and a queen. They were said to be the last of a distinguished Shia Muslim royal line. Before moving to the crumbling forest palace, they had taken up residence in the first-class waiting room of the Delhi railway station. While in exile at the station, they demanded that their lineage be recognised.
Ellen Barry, a New York Times journalist, unpicks this wild and at times unsettling story with great care and sensitivity in the three-part series for the Daily, The Jungle Prince of Delhi. It sounds like folklore but by episode three it becomes deeply political. In the end it’s a story of family, homeland, dislocation, trauma and the damage done by Partition. And at its conclusion, it had me weeping. – Brigid Delaney, columnist
This is the story of coworking juggernaut WeWork and its cult-like founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, who took the company from living room start-up to blockbuster valued at $47bn – before hubris sent it into a massive nosedive. This six-part series is a truly fascinating insight into the charlatans and grifters of the business world, from “disruptor” disciples to “unicorn” hunters, and the way it all thrives on hot air. As with all good tales of downfall, the best place to start is the beginning. – Stephanie Convery, deputy culture editor
Its host Molly Fischer has now left the show, but while she was at the helm, The Cut on Tuesdays provided 48 bingeable episodes of well-reported, feminist, funny discussion from topics ranging from the very heavy (what it’s like to be a woman in a migrant caravan) to the light and effervescent (what it means to be horny in 2019). This show listens like a conversation between your smartest girlfriends, who just so happen to be very good journalists. It sounded like everything female-focused media should be, but often isn’t. Start with the episode about pubic hair for a chat that’s often had in private, made public, or Welcome to my Bad Dinner Party, for a cooking challenge with a difference, made even tastier by the wisdom of Samin Nosrat. – Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor
Molly is diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, leaves her unhappy marriage of 15 years and embarks on a series of sexual adventures – then sits down in a studio and tells her best friend Nikki all about it.
Start from episode one, but episode two is when you’ll be clutching your sides laughing and/or dying of embarrassment. It’s a great reflection on what it means to feel alive, even when death is just around the corner. – Ellen Leabeater, audio producer

Mayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.
But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly spilled out of the forest in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.
I travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from biodiversity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.
It took a day by canoe and then many hours along degraded forest logging roads, passing Baka villages and a small goldmine, to reach the village. There, I found traumatised people still fearful that the deadly virus, which kills up to 90% of the people it infects, would return.
Villagers told me how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died.
Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.
But a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of biodiversity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.
Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?
“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, recently wrote in the New York Times. “We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”
Research suggests that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are crossing from animals to humans, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals.
Some, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as Marburg, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is linked to camels in the Middle East, are new to humans and spreading globally.
Other diseases that have crossed into humans include Lassa fever, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria; Nipah from Malaysia; and Sars from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like Zika and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and become established on other continents.
Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”.
In 2008, Jones and a team of researchers identified 335 diseases that emerged between 1960 and 2004, at least 60% of which came from animals.
Increasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.
The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”
Jones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”
“There are countless pathogens out there continuing to evolve which at some point could pose a threat to humans,” says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Infection and Global Health. “The risk [of pathogens jumping from animals to humans] has always been there.”
The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. “We have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,” he says.
“Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s  department of  environmental  sciences, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.
“I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. “The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.”
Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals – in which the virus is naturally circulating – and themselves. “We fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza; we can expect large-scale human mortalities; we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” Gillespie says.
Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.”
Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease. “Altering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme bacteria,” he says.
Yet human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.
“There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,” he says.
Ostfeld points to rats and bats, which are strongly linked with the direct and indirect spread of zoonotic diseases. “Rodents and some bats thrive when we disrupt natural habitats. They are the most likely to promote transmissions [of pathogens]. The more we disturb the forests and habitats the more danger we are in,” he says.
Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode biodiversity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit new diseases to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for existing diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.
Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.
The “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell numerous wild animals, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.
Equally, urban markets in west and central Africa sell monkeys, bats, rats, and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage.
“Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”
The Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been shut by the Chinese authorities, and last month Beijing outlawed the trading and eating of wild animals except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.
“The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,” says Jones.
“These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene.
Fevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), argue in a blog post that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.
“It is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease is not always so clear cut.”
So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?
Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she adds.
“The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.
“We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”
Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start with one or two people. The solutions start with education and awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,” he says. “They want to know what to do. They want to learn.”
Fevre and Tacoli advocate rethinking urban infrastructure, particularly within low-income and informal settlements. “Short-term efforts are focused on containing the spread of infection,” they write. “The longer term – given that new infectious diseases will likely continue to spread rapidly into and within cities – calls for an overhaul of current approaches to urban planning and development.”
The bottom line, Bird says, is to be prepared. “We can’t predict where the next pandemic will come from, so we need mitigation plans to take into account the worst possible scenarios,” he says. “The only certain thing is that the next one will certainly come.”

Glastonbury 2020: festival postponed due to coronavirus

Lanre Bakare","Festival confirms 2020 event due to feature Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar will take place in 2021


Wed 18 Mar 2020 11.51 GMT


First published on Wed 18 Mar 2020 10.58 GMT


Glastonbury festival, which was due to celebrate its 50th anniversary year in 2020 with headliners including Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar, has been cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
The festival confirmed via Twitter on Wednesday that the event, which was set to take place from 24-28 June at its usual home of Worthy Farm in Somerset, was off “following the new government measures announced this week – and in times of such unprecedented uncertainty – this is now our only viable option”.
A statement from Michael and Emily Eavis said that although they hoped the situation in the UK would have improved by the end of June, it was not viable to spend the next three months with thousands of crew on the farm, and 2020 would therefore be “an enforced fallow year”.
“We were so looking forward to welcoming you all for our 50th anniversary with a lineup full of fantastic artists and performers that we were incredibly proud to have booked. Again, we’re so sorry that this decision has been made. It was not through choice,” they said.
Ticketholders will have the chance to roll their £50 deposit over to next year, and guarantee the opportunity to buy a ticket for Glastonbury 2021, while those who want a refund can apply for one. Further information on coach packages, official accommodation bookings and other tickets will be added to the festival’s website in the next few days. 
The festival had taken a business-as-usual approach until only a few days ago, announcing its third and final headliner – LA rapper Kendrick Lamar was unveiled as the Friday night bill-topper – last week.
Last Thursday, the festival announced an additional 90 acts – including Pet Shop Boys, Dua Lipa and Noel Gallagher –  but less than a week later the impact of the Covid-19 virus was deemed so severe that the festival was no longer tenable.
The cancellation will be a huge blow to the festival, with some estimating losses could be as high as £100m, and will ruin its 50th anniversary year.
When announcing the lineup additions last week, Emily Eavis said they came “after much consideration given the current circumstances, and with the best of intentions”, but that they didn’t have a crystal ball and at that point were working hard to deliver the event while closely monitoring developments.
The announcements came shortly after the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that late June was likely to be just after the peak of the outbreak.
The festival has become one of the most celebrated cultural events in Europe since its humble beginnings as a gathering of 1,500 people in September 1970. It has grown into an event with more than 200,000 attendees, and its 50th anniversary year was set to be a vintage edition.
As well as Pyramid Stage headliners Lamar, McCartney and Swift other acts included Pet Shop Boys, Dua Lipa and Fatboy Slim, while Diana Ross was set to play the Sunday teatime “legend” slot, and Lana Del Rey, who would have played just before Lamar on the Pyramid stage.
Glastonbury is the latest high-profile cultural event or institution to be affected by the outbreak. On Monday evening, all major British theatres announced they were closing, while on Tuesday most big museums and galleries, including the Natural History Museum and the Tate facilities, said they would no longer be open to the public."

Australia's economic victims of coronavirus, just like the health victims, need help now
",Contact author,"No one deserves to lose their job because of coronavirus, and there is no good argument against boosting Newstart now


Wed 18 Mar 2020 02.00 GMT

Most people agree we should do all we can to help those who – through no fault of their own – contract Covid-19. The government is, rightly, about to spend billions of dollars on health services to help those who need it. No one expects people to get through coronavirus on their own.
But when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who are about to lose their jobs because of Covid-19, our public policy response is not nearly so generous.
The median full-time wage in Australia is $68,000 a year. A person who is laid off from their job will land in a Newstart safety net of almost $14,500 a year. How many weeks could you pay for food, rent, mortgage or car payments on $280 a week?
For decades, governments have justified the rations we provide to the unemployed, with claims such as:
1. “Newstart isn’t like the age pension, because people don’t have to live on it for long.” Leaving aside the fact that the average bout of unemployment in Australia lasts more than 10 months, there is no doubt that over the next six months a wave of newly unemployed people will be queuing up for Newstart. And the more people that enter the ranks of the unemployed, the longer the average bout of unemployment will last.
2. “If Newstart would be ‘too generous’, people would have no incentive to look for work.” Again, leaving aside the fact there was never any strong evidence that a lack of effort or searching (as opposed to a shortage of jobs) was the cause of unemployment, surely, no one believes that an airline worker who gets stood down from their $80,000 per year job needs any more incentive to return to work than their employer allowing them to.
But just as there’s no reason to lay blame on people who need intensive care because they’ve contracted Covid-19, there is absolutely no reason to blame the retail workers, tourism workers or teachers who are likely to find themselves without an income in the coming weeks. And it’s hard to imagine why we wouldn’t help them.
Another argument for not helping the unemployed is that individuals should have prepared themselves for a “rainy day”. This argument was put most gratuitously by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, who suggested casual workers – around 40%  of whom are below 25 years old – should have “already made provisions” for an event like being told they can’t work for 14 days because of a global health pandemic. No wonder people think the government is out of touch.
But luckily for the unemployed, the once-fiscally conservative Coalition are desperately looking for new things to spend money on so they can prevent GDP, and their polling numbers, crashing too badly.
There are currently around 734,000 people on Newstart. And while far from generous, the age pension is a full 54% higher than Newstart, at $430.30 per week. If we boosted the income of those on Newstart by the $10,000 difference between their payment and the age pension, the cost over 12 months would only be around $7.3bn.
But of course we shouldn’t stop with the unemployed. For the course of this crisis we should boost the weekly incomes of all beneficiaries, all of whom are among the lower state income earners, and all of whom will struggle with less casual work and the higher costs for staples.
The government has already announced its first $17.6bn stimulus package and is reportedly working on its second. There might even be a third and fourth round of stimulus, as the length of this pandemic makes itself apparent. Given the obvious needs of those with the least work and on the lowest incomes, and given the government’s need to pump money into the economy, there is literally no argument against boosting Newstart payments other than “they don’t deserve it”.
But no one “deserves” to get Covid-19. And no one deserves to lose their job or stay stuck in unemployment because of Covid-19 either.
Australia is one of the richest countries in the world. While we have high levels of household debt we have very low levels of public debt. State and federal governments will likely borrow more than $100bn over the course of this health crisis. That’s a very good thing.
Decades of political sloganeering have convinced large sections of the media, and of the population, that government borrowing is wasteful, a burden on future generations, or both. But – as all of the media and all of the population are about to learn – almost no economists or politicians actually believe that.
Allegedly there are no atheists in a foxhole, and history tells us that everyone becomes a Keynesian when they are tasked with avoiding a recession.
Just as borrowing money to buy a house or get a uni degree makes sense because the future benefits are greater than the interest costs, borrowing money to avoid a recession and save tens of thousands of jobs can set Australia up for decades. It’s a pity it takes a pandemic to drive such honesty into our public debate, but we should take advantage of the honesty nonetheless.
Whether it’s pumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy via Kevin Rudd’s $950 cheques to nearly everyone or through Scott Morrison’s $750 cheques to the unemployed and age pensioners, boosting benefits is a highly effective way to keep money going through cash registers, and in turn, keep people in their jobs. Think of the “cash splash” element of economic stimulus as buying a lower rate of unemployment. Virtually all economists think it’s a bargain.
But the stimulus will need to be much bigger and last much longer than one-off cheques. That’s why the government should increase weekly payments for more Australians, and think about all of the projects we can start building today that will serve us well into the future.
Just as a lot of people being stuck at home will bring forward some household painting, gardening and minor repairs, so too should governments use “idle time” and record low interest rates to bring forward housing, energy and transport projects. We don’t need to choose between a cash splash or big long run projects. The economy needs both, now.
But more importantly, the economic victims of Covid-19 – just like the health victims in intensive care – need help, now. Offering to help later is the same as not offering to help at all.

U2 frontman Bono has performed his first new music since 2017 with a song inspired by Italians quarantined during the coronavirus outbreak.
He posted the new song, Let Your Love Be Known, to his Instagram account with the caption: “For the Italians who inspired it… for the Irish… for ANYONE who this St Patrick’s Day is in a tight spot and still singing. For the doctors, nurses, carers on the front line, it’s you we’re singing to.”
 for ANYONE who this St. Patrick’s day is in a tight spot and still singing. For the doctors, nurses, carers on the front line, it's you we’re singing to. Bono
A post shared by  U2 Official (@u2) on Mar 17, 2020 at 2:28pm PDT
Apparently at home in Dublin, he says he wrote Let Your Love Be Known an hour before posting it, and performs it solo on piano. The lyrics see him walk through a deserted Dublin, and speak of isolation and fear amid the coronavirus outbreak. But inspired by the footage of quarantined Italians singing to each other from their balconies, he sings: “You can’t touch but you can sing across rooftops / sing to me down the phone / sing and promise me you won’t stop / sing and you’re never alone.”
The song was released on St Patrick’s Day as celebrations were cancelled in Ireland and worldwide because of social distancing guidelines.
U2’s most recent album was Songs of Experience, released in December 2017. They performed a world tour, Innocence and Experience, in 2018, and in 2019 took their Joshua Tree anniversary tour to Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
Yes there was silenceyes there was no people hereyes I walked through the streets of Dublin and no-one was nearYes I don’t know youNo I didn’t think I didn’t careYou live so very far away from just across the squareAnd I can’t reach but I can rainYou can’t touch but you can sing Across rooftopsSing down the phoneSing and promise me you won’t stopSing your love, be known, let your love be known.
Yes there is isolationYou and me we’re still hereYes when we open our eyes we will stare down the fearAnd maybe I’ve said the wrong thingYes I made you smileI guess the longest distance is always the last mile. And I can’t reach but I can rainYou can’t touch but you can sing Across rooftopsSing to me down the phoneSing and promise me you won’t stopSing and you’re never alone.Sing as an act of resistanceSing though your heart is overthrownWhen you sing there is no distanceSo let your love be known, oh let your love be known Though your heart is overthrown.Let your love be known."

'A ghost-town, tumbleweed quality': New York shuts down over coronavirus

Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.00 GMT

It was romantic, in a post-apocalyptic sort of way.
A young couple, walking arm-in-arm in downtown Manhattan, huddled under their shared umbrella. Their eyes seemed bright, filled with affection – and, unlike the bottom half of their faces, unobscured by pale blue surgical masks.
They were among those meandering this part of New York City despite widespread anxiety over coronavirus. While neighborhoods were not completely dead, many shops were closed and there was a marked decline in foot traffic.
As coronavirus cases continue to spike in New York and across the US, individuals, authorities, and institutions are all taking steps to contain this outbreak. New York’s court system has slowed to a crawl. Public schools here are shuttered. The city has ordered its world famous restaurants and bars theaters closed, except for takeout. Broadway shows have gone dark.
In Chinatown, coronavirus-spurred quietude was most apparent with empty and shuttered eateries. Many bakeries, usually abuzz with customers buying buns and coffee, were near-empty.
“Under these dire circumstances selections may be limited,” advised one bakery’s sign. It was printed on paper and affixed to the window. Other signs posted on doors advised customers of temporary and indefinite closures. Through windows, chairs were seen stacked atop tables. Salespersons in some of the neighborhood’s eyeglass and jewelry stores stood idle, waiting for customers.
Slightly north, a sign in a still-open Little Italy bakery advised clients: “For Your Safety + Ours, No More Than 4 People At a Time.”
Handbags and haute couture sat unsold at closed boutiques as one neared the chic Soho neighborhood, though some signs advised prospective customers that they could make shopping appointments.
On Broadway, walking Downtown from Houston Street, the sidewalks were near-empty. Victoria’s Secret, normally swarmed with patrons picking over buy-three, get-three unmentionables, was locked. The Prada outlet once popularized by Sex In the City, was newly silent.
Further south, near city hall, a man ambled down the sidewalk, toting a cylindrical container of sanitizing wipes. One white disinfectant sheet was sticking out.
“As much as I like my dentist, I don’t trust the seat was being fully cleaned,” said the man, Mark Oldman, who had a dental appointment. “You have to bring your own.”
“The hottest accessory on the streets of New York is no longer an iPhone,” he joked.
Did the city seem different to him, with all the closings?
“It feels like Thanksgiving,” he said of the US holiday, during which many New York City residents leave town. “Not completely dead, it just has this kind of ghost-town, tumbleweed quality.”
“It’s not as apocalyptic as the TV news would suggest,” he continued. “I just saw a woman walk into Zara and I thought, ‘that’s interesting, shopping during the plague.’”
There were other glimpses of cautious normalcy.
Two construction workers conversed while walking towards Wall Street. One had a N-95 respirator mask on his face, and it somehow remained in place though the straps were down. His companion was not wearing a mask, and he spat on the ground as they walked.
Near the Civic Center, a young woman in a surgical mask exited a college building. She sat on a bench and pulled down her mask, so it rested below her chin. Then, she lit a cigarette. She smoked , though it entails repeated hand-mouth contact.
Back near Chinatown, a queue had formed outside the city marriage bureau. Because of social distancing initiatives, only 50 people were permitted inside at a time, slowing down the licensing process.
Rei Hayashi and Ben Shaul, who have been together eight years, were among those waiting. The license is just “paperwork”, Hayashi and Shaul said, but they had the time to come down and decided to get it.
Hayashi, who has legal permanent residency, was concerned about potential border closures.
“It’s just checking off boxes,” Shaul said.
Federica Bressan, a Fulbright Scholar who plans on returning to her hometown of Gorizia, Italy on Sunday. She is “heartbroken” to leave New York City and while she doesn’t fear coronavirus here per se, “It’s the uncertainty. I don’t know what’s going to happen.”
“No matter what happens, I think being at home is always better.”"

AFL season to start on time despite coronavirus pandemic

The AFL 2020 competition will start on schedule on Thursday night with reigning premiers Richmond to host Carlton at the MCG, beginning what league CEO Gillon McLachlan has called a season “that will not look like any other”.
The decision to push ahead in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic came after a marathon AFL Commission meeting followed by a teleconference with all 18 club chief executives on Wednesday.
“I think the Commission needed to consider widely and understand the position clearly of the chief medical officer and the medical industry, of government, of our clubs, our presidents, our industry really,” McLachlan said.
The first four of a scheduled 17 rounds will be crammed into a quicker time frame if possible, with the competition to be postponed immediately if and when any player or official tests positive to coronavirus.
The AFLW season will also go ahead this weekend, although the last two home and away rounds have been ditched, with the finals to commence straight away.
Some 88% of AFL players voted on Monday night in favour of starting the season this week despite the outbreak of Covid-19, which has prompted sporting leagues around the world to shut down.
“Our industry is unified in making a decision to start,” said McLachlan. “The reality is that this season will not look like any other. As I said earlier in the week this is an unprecedented challenge and it is going to take unprecedented action to get through it all
“We’ve taken action in both the men’s and women’s seasons. The 153 games will not look like a standard 17-round season. But footy is resilient and footy will find a way through.”
Earlier in the day, Richmond coach Damien Hardwick said the Tigers were ready and willing to kick off their premiership defence against the Blues. All round-one games will be played behind closed doors with shortened 16-and-a-half minute quarters plus time-on.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a range of new measures on Wednesday morning, including a ban on all non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. But the prime minister made it clear that it was up the AFL and NRL to determine whether or not to postpone their seasons."

The AFLW’s final two rounds have been cancelled due to the impact of the coronavirus with the competition to enter an eight-team finals series. The top four teams from each conference will play off starting this weekend – an increase from the scheduled six due to the shortened regular season.
North Melbourne, GWS, Brisbane and Gold Coast advance from conference A, while Fremantle, Carlton, Melbourne and Collingwood go through from conference B. The full schedule will be announced on Thursday.
It follows a marathon meeting at AFL House on Wednesday, with league boss Gillon McLachlan confirming men’s and women’s games would proceed this weekend amid the pandemic.
With 14 sides in this year’s competition – including three newcomers – a three-week finals series was introduced for the AFLW’s fourth season.
All games will continue to be played behind closed doors due to the federal government’s initiatives to contain the spread of coronavirus.
Head of women’s football, Nicole Livingstone, said: “We would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to all 14 clubs and players in our competition, who have worked incredibly hard across the season. They should be extremely proud of what they have achieved.
“Particularly to the clubs that will be concluding their 2020 season; Adelaide Crows, Geelong, Western Bulldogs, and new comers West Coast Eagles, St Kilda and Richmond, thank you for your care and commitment to AFLW, your programs and your players.
“We look forward to the next three weeks of finals, and wish all eight teams the best of luck.”
After Adelaide won the 2019 grand final against Carlton in front of a record 53,034 fans, this year’s premiership will be decided without spectators.
“Whilst the immediate progression to a finals series in the AFLW competition will be met with disappointment from players, all players should be very proud of what they’ve achieved in season 2020,” AFL Players’ Association CEO Paul Marsh said.
“This has been an incredibly challenging week for the industry and we wish to acknowledge the AFL for the dedication it has shown to find a way through this unprecedented situation.”"

The lamps are going out. They will be lit again across Europe – 15 months from now if current timescales hold. Although what traumas the 12 host cities for Uefa’s Euros of Everywhere might have endured by then is open to uncomfortable speculation.
For now Rome’s piazzas are empty. Bucharest has declared a state of emergency. Madrid feels “like a meteorite has fallen on us”. As for the final venue, London, well, this place is coming like a ghost town.
The decision to postpone Euro 2020 was announced on Tuesday afternoon after a video‑link conference of Uefa’s member associations. But it came as a surprise to nobody.
Such is the speed of the news cycle it is hard to recall such ostensibly huge sporting news that has felt like such an afterthought.
This time last week Liverpool were preparing to take on Atlético Madrid at Anfield and the established version of sporting reality seemed to be holding, just about. It took us a week to get from there to here. What paradigm shifts will the next five weeks hold? European football does at least have a revised, sensible-looking start date for this benighted, cumbersome sporting white elephant. Euro 2020 is now officially Euro 2021, destined to run from 11 June to 11 July with details and logistics to fall into step behind.
What to make of this? It has become a reflex action to quail and froth at every decision made by the executive in every sphere. In reality there is no good solution to any of this, just as the postponement of European football’s £2bn cash cow shrinks into insignificance alongside the wider effects of the current viral slowdown.
Like every other industry football is faced with guesswork, compromise and a sharp-faced divvying up of the remaining wealth and space.
There is at least time now to regroup and salvage something of the great global circus; and to make some brittle-looking plans. The Champions League final has been put on hold, with some speculation of a final in high summer although it is worth remembering such statements are not solely directed at the watching public.
The key discussions now are with rights holders, sponsors, insurers and above all lawyers. Best efforts are being made, just as best efforts must always be made where huge contractual payments are at issue. Pencil that date in. But not too heavily. In reality we are all subject to events now, and to an altered perspective.
For those consumed by football’s weekly operetta it seems axiomatic that domestic competitions must be completed, that the world turns on these certainties. It is worth bearing in mind current projections are for peak-infection to arrive in the UK in early June. How will football feel in a world of isolation, infection, body counts and potential health‑service collapse? There is a time to play games. Whatever the illusion of control, we are all essentially spectators to this wider drama.
Beyond the coming summer Uefa will have to decide what it wants to do with the women’s Euros, which would overlap this revised men’s tournament by four days.
Perhaps the day will arrive sooner rather than later when, as in tennis, men’s and women’s tournaments can be played near-simultaneously, although that is a wider debate about visibility and projection. Separately there is also the Nations League (won’t someone think of the Nations League?) to be crammed in and World Cup 2022 qualifiers to be negotiated.
These questions of scheduling can all be solved. The wider issue once seasons have been fudged and losses minimised is exactly where this leaves us. Football in the time of pandemic; in the time of anti-globalism; in an increasingly perilous-seeming world. How should it work? What’s the plan? Certainly this has always felt like a cursed tournament. Welcome to the Damned Euros. Will we ever be free of them? At the start of all this Michel Platini called his pan‑European show “zany, but a good idea”. In practice it has been neither.
Uefa’s plan was a product of the banking meltdown in Europe, which deprived football of a suitably lavish and willing host. The border‑hopping, low-cost air‑travel compromise was a response to this. Eight years on The Euros of Everywhere occupies a neat but sickly position, bookended by two global crises.
There is something extra poignant in their failure. The European Championship was conjured initially out of a spirit of hope, and of internationalism. Henri Delaunay, the first general secretary of Uefa, was hugely enthused by the ideals of the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor to the EU. His championship, the first edition of which eventually kicked off two years after his death, was in some small part a force for integration and progress.
That skein of idealism has of course been consumed by the urge to expand and monetise this wildly successful arm of the entertainment industry.
At the end of which Uefa has ended up bringing us this ludicrously distended version, with matches staged 3,200 miles apart, and one quarter-final due to take place at a point east of Riyadh.
Even before the current crisis this has not been a story of endless growth. The Euros has looked for some time like an ailing, overstretched concept. Last time around the players were tired, the football lukewarm, the 24-team structure a failure.
 What was decided today?
The European Championship will not take place this summer, with Uefa rescheduling it for 11 June to 11 July 2021. European football’s governing body also decided that play-off matches for Euro 2020 and international friendlies due to take place at the end of March will be played in the international window at the start of June, subject to a review of the situation with coronavirus. There may be further complications should the Republic of Ireland qualify for the Euros, with their manager, Mick McCarthy, due to be replaced by Stephen Kenny in August, and several other managers of qualified nations are out of contract in June, including Belgium’s Roberto Martínez.
What does it mean for Champions League and Europa League?
Uefa has established a working group with the participation of leagues and club representatives and aims “to complete all domestic and European club competitions by the end of the current sporting season, ie 30 June 2020 at the latest, should the situation improve and resuming playing be appropriate and prudent enough”.
What about the women’s Euros?
Scheduled to begin on 7 July 2021 at Old Trafford – four days before the men’s final will now take place at Wembley – Uefa has said the tournament will move but not to when. A year’s delay is an option. The Nations League finals and Under-21 Championship, also scheduled for summer 2021, will be rearranged too. Fifa’s newly expanded World Club Cup, due in China between 17 June and 4 July 2021, should move, its president, Gianni Infantino, said.
What if I have Euro 2020 tickets?
Uefa wants the format of 24 teams playing across 12 venues to stay and has said all tickets are transferable, with existing ticket buyers and hospitality clients able to claim refunds “for the face value of their tickets and packages in full”.
Euro 2016 ended with French fans mooching out of the Stade de France as Portugal’s players took the fireworks, and a general sense of relief that an event staged under a state of national emergency had come to a peaceful end.
In the meantime football’s calendar has become more bloated, the product stretched ever thinner. Even assuming a mass recovery, the players will face a brutal catch-up programme, with club competitions sliced and diced, and a rearranged Euros followed by a rearranged winter World Cup the following year.
In the middle of which, here’s one hopeful thought. It seems likely Europe will now enter a time of austerity, uncertainty, even horror. Sport has always been at its best as a source of celebration and collectivism, as a note of beauty that stands outside the real world. A Euros in 2021 does at least offer the promise of some kind of re‑emergence. Distant as it seems, it could even be a time of joy."

Australian motor sport has turned to the virtual world of esports to fill the void created by the postponement of the Supercars championship due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Supercars on Wednesday announced it had called off the series’ next three rounds in Tasmania, Auckland and Perth, following the cancellation of last weekend’s event at Albert Park in Melbourne after just one day of racing.
Given the sport’s “visceral” appeal, the Supercars boss Sean Seamer said it is the intention of organisers to reschedule the races for later in the year rather than run the races behind closed doors.
In the meantime, drivers will still be able to showcase their skills – just from in front of a television screen, rather than behind a windscreen – with plans for e-races to be hosted on social media and Fox Sports.
Teams will run their own virtual Supercars from drivers’ own homes on a weekly basis using the iRacing platform. Exact scheduling will be confirmed in the coming days.
“Fans will get to see our stars battle it out in a virtual world while we wait to go racing again for real,” Seamer said.
The racing will be livestreamed for free on Supercars’ official website and social media channels, and the international streaming platform Twitch. Fans with a Fox Sports or Kayo subscription will also be able to follow.
“Our sport is a visceral experience and rather than run without crowds, we have decided, along with our key broadcast and government partners, to delay any further racing until June,” Seamer said.
“Tasmania, Auckland and Perth events will all be postponed until later in the year, not cancelled. Fortunately, our calendar this year enables us to do this.
“Supercars’ priority is to deliver the 14-round 2020 championship for our fans and partners, irrespective of the dates. Bathurst will obviously proceed on its scheduled date.”
It is not the first time since the outbreak of Covid-19 stars of motor sport have turned to gaming – after last weekend’s Australian Grand Prix was called off at the last minute, Max Verstappen and Lando Norris both took part in separate virtual races.
McLaren’s Norris was joined by Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and former F1 drivers Stoffel Vandoorne and Esteban Gutierrez, along with esports professionals, in a virtual Australian GP, while Red Bull’s Verstappen raced in an “All-star Esports battle”."

Bernard Tomic endures blizzard of uncharitable scorn in self-isolation

When Bernard Tomic announced he was the first player on the ATP tour to self-isolate after showing symptoms of coronavirus, the 27-year-old Australian was not drowned in universal sympathy.
The Covid-19 pandemic has loosened the worst and best instincts of humanity and Tomic, who could have been one of the outstanding players of his generation, endured mostly a blizzard of scorn after telling an Australian newspaper on Sunday: “Since Tuesday, I started feeling not right. I already had shortness of breath and my immune system was low and run down. I’m currently in Miami and isolated away from everyone, as advised. I’m yet to be tested for [Covid-19] but I have all the symptoms.”
He will not lack for expert advice close to home; his mother, Ady, was a biomedical scientist. Quite what his belligerent father, John, will tell him is another matter.
Tomic believes he may have been infected while flying to Florida from one of his favourite tournaments, Monterrey, where he lost against his compatriot Aleksandar Vukic in the third round. But most fans were not interested. Tomic, who rose to a career-high 17 in the world in 2016 and now wallows at 200, could not buy a friend. 
The social media onslaught was relentless. “I think he’s just had dickheaditis,” said one. “Since when did he become Dr Bernard Tomic?” asked another. There were a slew of laughing memes and gifs, as well as abuse and nastiness. “Let’s hope he stays there forever,” was typical. One budding comedian observed: “Apparently he was lethargic, tired and could not chase the tennis ball. It was a wonder he was diagnosed at all, no difference to his normal behaviour.”
He has heard it for years. It was uncharitable, obviously, and, sadly, predictable. It confirmed what is obvious: memories can be short and unkind, especially when the target is a celebrity athlete with a history of entitlement and ordinary behaviour.
It should have been – and could have been – different. However, it was evident from the start of his career that Tomic was temperamentally ill-equipped to handle fame. He blundered from one minor public relations disaster to another, losing to players way below him in the rankings, and seeming not to care, as the money rolled in.
When Mischa Zverev blew him away in less than an hour-and-a-half in the first round at Wimbledon three years ago, he said he had no regrets, was bored and did not much like tennis. “Throughout my career I’ve given 100%,” he said. “I’ve given also 30%.” He then blew it up altogether: “Wouldn’t anyone want to take a job in ... one of the biggest sports in the world and only give 50, 60% and earn millions of dollars?”
His website has been dormant for years. The last result posted was his injury retirement after three games against Benoît Paire in the first round of the 2016 Italian Open. It was one of many such results, seen by his team as evidence of a failing body and zero focus, by his critics as a deficit of spirit.
On Facebook, he often showed his good side. His last entry, in February 2013, captioned a visit to a children’s hospital: “La Timone in Marseille this week, really enjoyed the experience – chatting and signing autographs with the kids.”
Not a lot has gone right for Tomic since he came through qualifying to take a set off Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2011. That might have been his breakthrough moment, as fans thrilled to his languid game. He showed exquisite touches and bursts of lazy power but not enough resilience under pressure when Djokovic stepped on the gas. Still, it was something memorable for a teenager to build on.
In fits and starts, injury and hubris undermined his talent thereafter. Arrogance and ignorance did not help. He went from prodigy to Tomic the Tank Engine. Patrick and John McEnroe called him out at Flushing Meadows in 2012 when he collapsed spectacularly against Andy Roddick. Tomic responded: “That’s how I play. Do you have a problem with that?”
For all his flaws and wasted gifts, he surely does not deserve the vilification that has fallen upon him in a health crisis such as the one he is enduring now. “People need to take this super seriously,” he told the Sydney Sun-Herald, “especially at home in Australia. I don’t know how long I’ll be in isolation or when I can be tested.”
Tomic may not realise it but he has been isolated for many years."

I saw colleagues die of Ebola. Health workers must not become coronavirus martyrs
",George Poe Williams,"We will be the group most affected by this outbreak. Governments must bury austerity and ensure care is adequately staffed and well-resourced


Wed 18 Mar 2020 10.58 GMT


Imagine working in an underfunded, understaffed hospital facing a devastating disease outbreak. Imagine being forced to make impossible choices about who to treat and who to let die. Imagine coming home to your family, knowing you might be putting them at risk.
These are the awful situations we health workers faced in dealing with the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Libera. For me the greatest tragedy is hearing similar stories emerge from colleagues around the world who are up against the coronavirus. It terrifies me to see that developed countries health systems are at breaking point – I hate to imagine what this virus might do to my region next.
We health workers are not heroes. And we should not have to became martyrs on the job. We are professionals. We need personal protective equipment so we can stay healthy while saving lives. We need adequately staffed and well-resourced public health systems. We need strong government funding for our sector.
The sad reality is public health systems have been consistently understaffed, underfunded and undermined – and privatised or outsourced. The disastrous failure of austerity policies is exacerbating the strain of this outbreak on our sector – and with deadly impact.
Fractured, profit-driven health systems are simply unable to effectively respond to crises such as Ebola or coronavirus. In the US, many with the virus do not have adequate access to healthcare and may risk exacerbating the spread. The only way we can tackle this outbreak is through a massive, government-driven, public health response – best achieved through established universal public healthcare.
During the Ebola crisis, my union fought tooth and nail for personal protective equipment for workers – yet chronic underfunding, partially a result of IMF and World Bank loan conditionality, meant the resources needed simply weren’t available. The disease ended up killing over 8% of the country’s health workforce. Many of my comrades perished in the struggle.
In the aftermath, I met workers around the world through the global union federation Public Services International to fight for more resilient public health systems. Our Safe Workers Save Lives campaign called on governments to increase funding and make sure that, when public health emergencies arise, workers are not sacrificed in the fight. Sadly, our calls went largely unanswered. And now the worst is coming.
We health workers will be the group most affected by this virus outbreak. Many of us will die, our families left behind. Many of our deaths will have been avoidable. This time we must learn. Governments must massively increase funding for public health systems – immediately. It’s time to bury austerity once and for all. Never has the need for well-funded, resilient public health systems been clearer.

","The truth is the Covid-19 test doesn’t change anything. Even without it we can all make a difference now • Australia coronavirus live: NSW government announces $2.3bn stimulus package
I’m standing at the entrance of a Covid-19 testing unit for a major Sydney hospital, being quizzed by a nurse about my symptoms.
“I’m sorry,”, she says. “I’ve had a lot of people lying to me to try to get tested. I have to be careful.”
It soon becomes clear that I meet the criteria for testing for coronavirus and I’m given a sticker with a number on it.
I join a quiet room full of people, each with a mask and a sticker. Staff members, wearing protective gloves, gowns, face masks and eye covering, are coming around to get each person’s details. Next, your “vital signs” – that is your heart and breathing rate, temperature, oxygenation and blood pressure – are recorded.
The woman sitting next to me sniffs loudly, then sneezes, and I shift uncomfortably in my chair. Being in a room full of people who all certainly have viruses and may possibly have Covid-19, is not relaxing. I think about how many items of my clothing, my bag and my umbrella are touching the area around me, and I wonder idly about how long the virus lasts on surfaces and if it can transfer from surface to surface.
Suddenly, the explosive cough that has been surprising me all week bursts once again from my mouth. My neighbour who sneezed earlier startles and shifts away from me in her chair. I don’t blame her. We are close together and I could feel my breath forcefully pushing out the sides of my mask.
After half an hour we are moved to a different set of chairs, waiting to move through to the testing area.
If you are worried you have coronavirus, you should act as if you do have it
At this point I realise I am one of the lucky ones. By now the line outside the clinic is snaking around the corner. As each new person gets to the front, they are imploring the nurse to let them in.
“But my friend was travelling and she is sick!”
“I’ve been living in a hotel and I don’t know who was there!”
Many respond with anger when she advises them they don’t meet guidelines for testing, that they should go home, self-isolate until their symptoms subside or they are advised otherwise. That they are better off not sitting in a room surrounded by sick people for two hours.
“Are you seriously telling me you don’t care about this??!” one man exclaims.
“But my work says I need a certificate to come in,” begs another.
Most are scared. They want to get tested because they want reassurance in what is frankly a confusing, unsettling time.
Ideally we would test people as widely as possible, but at the moment Australia is one of many countries affected by a worldwide shortage of testing kits. There is a real opportunity cost to testing people who don’t meet the criteria. In some labs they are being forced to delay or stop other important tests because they simply don’t have the resources to meet demand.
When it’s finally time to be tested, my details and symptoms are recorded again by another gowned staff member before I’m taken into a testing room. One swab (which looks like a giant cotton bud) is held at a right angle to my head and pushed inside my nostril, further back than it seems possible to go. It feels scratchy and sore just above my throat. Then the same swab is used again in the other side, before being placed in a bag and sent off. The whole thing takes only a couple of minutes but consumes a large amount of staff time and personal protective equipment.
Afterwards, my throat and nose are sore. And I feel oddly marked. Like somehow just by virtue of taking the test my status as a potential carrier has changed.
But the truth is, the test doesn’t change anything.
So if you don’t meet the criteria for testing right now, don’t panic.
There is still so much you can do. If you are worried you have coronavirus, you should act as if you do have it. Self-isolate. Be meticulous with hand-washing. Having a positive test won’t get you any better treatment in any way.
If you or someone you employ has viral symptoms, now is the time for you to show moral leadership. Don’t turn up at these overrun testing centres unless you meet the testing criteria for your state. Don’t require your employees to be tested or get a medical certificate. Just let them stay at home.
Two hours in a testing centre and an uncomfortable swab up the nose won’t change anything. If you become very unwell you will be managed the same way, and you will be tested anyway. Even without the tests, we can all make a difference now.

Adrienne Matei","With millions of us lying low to limit the spread of Covid-19, how best to manage being cooped up for days on end?


Tue 17 Mar 2020 14.07 GMT

By now, we all know that voluntary social distancing is key to mitigating the spread of Covid-19. In the grand scheme of things, lying low for a little while is a small sacrifice to make for the increased safety of all, though it certainly will pose challenges, not least of which being to our relationships.
“It will become easy to think of one another as a burden,” writes the Atlantic’s Helena Fitzgerald, “especially when we are cooped up together or when isolation breeds feelings of abandonment.” This raises the question: how can we best manage the unusual social circumstances we’re in?
In 2017, engineer Ansley Barnard spent eight months living in an isolated dome habitat with five other scientists as part of Nasa’s Hi-SEAS program, which was developed to simulate the experience of traveling to Mars. During that time, she learned several lessons applicable to anyone living with roommates.
“Talking about a potential conflict early on prevents things from getting worse,” says Barnard. “Our strategies in the habitat were to be open about our feelings and avoid blame. It can help to carve out private places in the same home so that you can decompress alone if you need to,” she says.
Barnard and her team ate dinner together every evening, using that time to set aside any issues and work on their relationships with each other. “I think having a positive attitude and looking at your situation as a temporary opportunity instead of a setback can help keep you moving forward,” she says.
According to Joshua David Stein, editor of the parenting publication Fatherly, if you’re practicing social distancing with your kids, now is the time to readjust your rule structure.
“Just like how when you take kids on a plane they can watch as much TV as they want – it’s kind of the same, at least for now,” he says. Fatherly has compiled a list of at-home activities for bored kids, the internet abounds with kid-friendly podcasts, museum tours and educational videos, and Stein notes that it’s a good time to get outside and take advantage of local parks, too.
If your kids are worried about grandparents they’re unable to visit during the pandemic, Stein suggests: “without lying, frame it in a way that will assuage their worries as much as possible. Like, ‘Grandma is doing fine, for her safety and our safety, we’re going to rely on FaceTime for now.’” It’s also to be expected that your patience will wear thin at times. “You’re going to freak out at your kids a little bit,” says Stein. “It’s not the best thing in the world but it’s not the end of the world, don’t beat yourself up about it, try to do better next time.”
“This is a situation where you kind of know what is going to happen so you have time to come up with a gameplan,” says Erin Davidson, a couples and sex therapist. “Chat about what to do in moments where things are stressful – normalize that it’s OK if you get on each other’s nerves, and decide on a signal that means ‘OK, we need to take a moment in separate rooms, or recognize better communication is needed, or perhaps someone needs a hug or to talk about emotions that are coming up.’”
Davidson says both partners should get comfortable asking for – and giving each other – space. While it may be a tricky time to date, low-risk, symptom-free partners living in relative isolation together can certainly use this time to have more sex. “There’s a website called MojoUpgrade.com and it’s fun because both of you fill out ‘yes-no-maybe’ questions about sexual things you want to try individually, and then it only emails you with the things you both matched up with a ‘yes’ on,” she says. “It’s a low-pressure fun thing you can do.”
For the last three years, writer and musician Kristal Jax has been making ironic, Barbie-heavy memes about coping with mental illness, trauma and social issues, which she posts to her Instagram account @Dyingbutfine. Several of Jax’s recent posts have centered on Covid-19, including a “quarantine bingo” meme and a multi-post filled with ideas for how to distract yourself while home alone, such as by crafting, cleaning or making your own memes. “I find humour is a way to connect and let off steam when you’re really upset or anxious – just have some kind of catharsis,” she says.
In addition to taking on domestic projects, Jax says reaching out to offer support to others, if you’re able, is a good way to feel less alone. “I find helping people during times of crisis really helps you control your own anxiety, because you’re like, ‘Oh, I have a purpose,’” she says. “If you don’t know someone well enough to know how they would feel about you checking in on them you could still send a message to them saying, ‘Hey, I’m checking in on friends right now, do you need anything?’” And if you’re completely cooped up, “know that you staying home is you doing something,” says Jax, “even if you feel powerless.”"

I have a job in China and left just before the coronavirus outbreak to visit my parents in the US. My wife, a Chinese citizen, wants me to return to meet her at our  apartment in a major Chinese city not far from the first afflicted province of Hubei, so that we can weather the crisis together. She believes that our life shouldn’t be put on hold for weeks or months, and that our different experiences of the outbreak might be pushing us apart. I’m eager to get back to her as soon as possible but worried that my travelling will endanger us both, not to mention cause  anxiety to my dad who is already struggling with serious health issues. On top of this, my government has advised strongly against travel to China and my boss has offered me a way to do my work online. How can I find a path towards making the right decision for myself, my wife and our marriage?
Did you see those huge lines at airports this week, hundreds of passengers crammed shoulder to shoulder so that customs halls around the world looked like livestock pens? Like you, I’d thought about being in those lines. I had thought that I needed to fly home to my parents and my grandparents while I still could, and that if anything happened to them while I was away I could never live with myself. Then I remembered that to pass through an airport right now is to endanger someone else’s loved one. This thing moves so fast, and tests have been so slow, that we simply do not know what each of us is carrying. Patient 31 in South Korea went to church twice and infected 1,000 people.
Once you grasp that moving around right now imposes risk on others, there’s no question left about whether it’s fair to do it, even so we can get back to our people. It’s not. Don’t travel unless you absolutely have to.
I know I’m asking a lot of you here. You asked how to make the best decision for yourself, your wife and your marriage, and instead I’m asking you to make this decision for people you’ve never met.
Your wife might be angry if you tell her you’re putting strangers over what she wants, and normally I’d think she was right. But we have to start caring about strangers, richly caring – caring in the way that makes us prepared to put their wellbeing before our own. What will unite us right now, and God knows we could use it, is finally seeing each other as worth making sacrifices for.
I am confident that patient 31 felt just like you and me: scared, lonely and wanting the joy and reassurance of a familiar group of people. Now thousands more are in danger who didn’t need to be.
It’s hard to realise while we’re in their grip but thoughts like “this will be really hard” and “I want to be around my people” don’t make us special exemptions from the collective, they throw us right in the thick of it.
There’s something galvanising about that; we can keep each other mentally in our pockets as we do the hard, boring, lonely things we will have to in the coming months. Somewhere I’ll wash my hands for you, while you stay home for me. I’ll think of your grandmother while I’m freezing a batch of soup and you think of mine while you bounce a tennis ball off the wall.
It’s a dusty adage (the best ones often are) that we reveal ourselves when we’re tested. Let the part of you that this crisis illuminates be a part that you’re proud of – one that takes other people as seriously as you hope to be taken.

Long-running Australian TV soap opera Neighbours will not film this week as a precaution in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
It has been reported that a person working on the show had come into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.
The cast and crew of the show, filmed in Melbourne, met on Wednesday. The show’s parent companies Network Ten and Fremantle have opted to take a break until Monday to adapt the production model for the drama to withstand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
“Production will resume on Monday as planned with no interruption to the on-air or delivery schedule. The health and well-being of everyone on the set of Neighbours will always be our priority,” a spokeswoman said.
The long-running show has been celebrating its 35 years on air this week, with the wedding of five couples on the show through the week.
“Forget about toilet paper and stock up on tissues, because with this many white dresses and hearfelt declarations of love, there won’t be a dry eye in the house. We’re not crying, you’re crying,” the Network Ten promo said.
Other sets that have confirmed to have shut down in Australia since the coronavirus pandemic include The Voice, Clickbait, Australia’s Got Talent, and The Power of the Dog.
Screen Producers Australia has called on the film industry in Australia to go public with how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting their business.
“Ours is a powerful and enduring industry that has had the resilience to weather many storms. This being said, Covid-19 represents a unique threat to our businesses and workers on a scale we have not faced in living memory – physical production is not a job that can be done from home,” CEO Matthew Deaner said.
“While we have issued advice to our members on pragmatic steps to take for health and safety on set and in regards to business continuity planning and insurance, we appreciate that it may simply not be possible to say ‘the show must go on’ at this point.”
The organisation is calling for government support for the 30,000 full-time roles in the sector.
The state of Victoria, where Neighbours is filmed, has had 121 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 27 new cases announced on Wednesday.
New restrictions will come into effect from tomorrow across Australia banning gatherings of 100 people or more indoors, and 500 people or more outdoors, with limited exceptions.
In Victoria, the state government announced anyone breaking the rule will face fines of up to $20,000 for individuals, and $100,000 for venues."

But on Monday Wyatt’s department, the National Indigenous Australians Agency wrote to providers to say “mutual obligations remain in place at this stage”, meaning that Aboriginal people will still be expected to turn up for group activities or risk losing their welfare payments.
“Any changes for particular areas affected by coronavirus or other extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis in line with existing procedures,” the NIAA chief executive, Ray Griggs, wrote in a letter obtained by Guardian Australia.
The letter said any community development program participant who was unwell and may have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 should call Centrelink to discuss obtaining a “major personal crisis exemption”, valid for 14 days, to “avoid any suspension of payment”.
But Amsant said that advice “raises public health concerns” and increases unnecessary risks.
“Preventing and slowing the spread of the virus must be our overwhelming priority,” Paterson said. “The stakes could not be higher.
“We have a narrow window of opportunity to prevent the spread of the virus into our communities. As the funder and contract managers of these non-essential programs, the Australian government must exercise its duty of care.”
Labor and the Greens have also called for a suspension of work for the dole and mutual obligation commitments.
“It’s time for the government to put the health of remote communities first and suspend mutual obligation requirements,” said Labor’s Indigenous Australians spokesperson, Linda Burney.
“At a time when travel to remote communities in the NT is being restricted it is completely inconsistent to force people to participate in group activities.”
“This isn’t just about people who are ill or required to self-isolate,” she said. “It’s about limiting risk for the whole community, including those who are sick and older.”
On Tuesday the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said “CDP activities play an important role in community life” and mutual obligations would stay in place for the time being.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

“Any changes for particular areas affected by coronavirus or other extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis,” a spokesman for the minister said.
This applied to all Australians who have mutual obligation requirements and was in line with health department advice, the minister’s office said.
But the Central Land Council said exemptions on a case-by-case basis would not work.
“Health services will be stretched to the limit and should not be burdened with having to issue medical certificates for individual CDP participants,” said its chief executive Joe Martin-Jard.
“The sensible and responsible thing to do is to cancel all participation requirements for the duration of the pandemic and allow our people to put their health and safety first.”
The Greens senator Rachel Siewert echoed calls for suspension, and said people might make decisions that endanger their health or others out of fear of losing their payments. “Our first priority should be looking after people’s health and, as we surely move towards more people needing to isolate and socially distance, will this government still expect those on income support to be attending meetings and appointments?” Siewert asked.
Amsant said the risk factors for Covid-19 were greater than the H1N1 virus in 2009, which resulted in death rates among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population six times higher than the non-Indigenous community.
“We need a clear, consistent and appropriate response that will best support individuals and communities and contribute to the efforts of government and community organisations to deal with this crisis.”"

Passengers can ask airlines for a credit for a cancelled flight but getting through to customer service will be a major challenge as Qantas and Jetstar cause chaos by grounding the majority of their international and domestic fleet.
The national carrier announced on Tuesday that 90% of international flights and 60% of domestic flights will be cancelled from the end of the month until the end of May, and Virgin is widely tipped to follow suit within days.
The airlines will honour the bookings with a flight credit voucher, which you can use within a fairly generous period of 12 months, but there is a deadline of 31 March for applying. The change fees – even on the cheapest restricted tickets – will be waived. However, the customer will have to cover the difference in the fare, if any.
Passengers who would like a full refund may be granted one if they insist, the aviation commentator Steve Creedy told Guardian Australia.
“At the moment most airlines are offering people the capacity to take a credit and I understand if you push they’ll give you a refund as well,” the editor of Airline Ratings said.
“But the offer is for a credit for a flight at a later date. If you still absolutely want to fly in April or May given the drop in demand you may be able to fly but not necessarily on the flight you originally booked.”
The advice is don’t even try to get through on the phone; and if your flight is in the next day or so the airlines will contact you.
Some passengers have had success by contacting the company through its Facebook page.
“You can’t call,” Creedy said. “Pretty much all the call centres everywhere around the world are overloaded at the moment.
“It varies from airline to airline but unless you’re going to fly in the next 48 to 72 hours don’t call.”
If you booked your flights through a travel agent or a platform such as Booking.com or Webjet you need to contact them directly as Qantas won’t deal with your inquiry.
Qantas is advising on its website that due to high demand they’re experiencing long call wait times and are only dealing with urgent travel dates.
“We strongly encourage only those customers travelling within the next 48 hours to contact us if needed,” Qantas advises. “Consider contacting us at another time if you’re travelling outside this period.”
Creedy says the only way to contact any airline at the moment is online but even that can be frustrating.
“What I’ve found is that some airlines you can’t get online either,” he said.
Creedy said the grounding of so many flights was unprecedented.
“There’s been reductions in capacity before but not to the extent that we’ve seen here,” Creedy said. “This is bigger than anything I’ve seen in the quarter of a century I’ve been covering aviation in Australia.
“And it’s not just in Australia, of course, it’s global. American Airlines had huge cuts, Delta, Air Canada. They’re all trying to preserve cash. They don’t want to fly empty planes around and burn money.”
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has issued guidelines for consumers on their rights with event and travel cancellations due to the threat of Covid-19.

Qantas and Jetstar said on Tuesday that significant falls in travel demand due to coronavirus and government restrictions meant further and much larger cuts to domestic and international flying schedules were necessary.
Creedy said passengers who chose to still fly during the restrictions would find the few planes in the air relatively empty.
“Delta said even with a 50% reduction in capacity in April and May they still only expected their planes to be 20 to 30% full,” Creedy said.
“With Qantas down to just 10% capacity I assume they’ll be pretty full, mainly with people coming home to Australia. With domestic it’s only a 60% cut so you should still be able to get a seat.
While flights will be refundable, travellers are faced with a headache for any land plans they made. Travel insurance taken out after late January will not be paid by most insurance companies.
Last week Qantas announced a 23% reduction in international flights and a 5% reduction in domestic flights, representing the grounding of 150 planes. Those original reductions between May and mid-September were still in place.
Qantas said flexibility would remain in place because things were changing rapidly.
“Customers who make a new domestic or international booking and later decide they no longer wish to travel, can cancel their flight and retain the value of the booking as a Qantas travel credit or Jetstar travel voucher. This applies to bookings made from 10 March 2020 until 31 March 2020 for travel before 31 May 2020.”"

Tue 17 Mar 2020 16.30 GMT


Last modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 10.54 GMT


The federal health department says it sees “merit” in a newly developed rapid Covid-19 testing kit able to return results within 15 minutes, which experts say could help relieve significant pressure on pathology services.
Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has warned the country faces “extreme pressure” supplying enough testing kits as the rate of infection continues to skyrocket, warning last week that the number of pathology testing kits, reagents and swabs was “deteriorating rapidly” with some regions now completely out of supplies.
The government has so far refused to say how many testing kits remain in the country, although the health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Tuesday the supply was “sufficient for current requirements”.
As the virus spread in Wuhan, Chinese researchers developed a more rapid “point of care” screening test, which detects antibodies that emerge some time after Covid-19 symptoms appear. A study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology said the test could return results within 15 minutes, much faster than the current standard testing.
The test – known as the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit – is not currently in use in Australia, but the Guardian understands some companies are seeking to supply it onto the market.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the rapid test had “merit” and that there were “no compelling reasons not to use it based on the described science and methodology”.
But she said the company behind it, the Nantong Egens Biotechnology Company Ltd, had not yet approached the regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for assessment and approval.
Such a device would need to be approved through the TGA’s in-vitro diagnostics regulatory scheme before use, the department said.
The company has had the test validated by laboratories in Europe and China. But the spokeswoman said the same would need to occur in Australia.
“Tests also require validation by testing laboratories in the Australian context before use,” she said.
“The Department of Health, in collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Network, is monitoring the development of test kits and methodologies and their performance as they are used more widely around the world.”
In Australia, a company called COVID-19 Rapid is representing three manufacturers seeking to get TGA approval for the rapid tests. A company spokesman said: “Our TGA consultants have told us that unlike the US and Europe, securing approval will take too long and be very expensive.”
Experts approached by the Guardian said the testing had potential benefits and drawbacks. The testing does not require a laboratory, which could help alleviate pressure on Australia’s pathology services and the rest of the health system.
Peter White, a virologist from the University of New South Wales, said if it were possible for rapid tests to be used by people at home it would help take the burden off an already strained health system.
“These tests will be useful for sure, they could keep infected people out of the health system and they do also provide peace of mind,” he said.
“There are certainly some advantages. If someone thinks they have the virus and can do the test at home in 15 minutes that’s someone who isn’t presenting at a hospital, GP or pathology lab.
“Even if you received a false positive, if you were able to take the precaution of having it backed up with [a traditional test] it would be good. If people received a negative result, they might be less inclined to visit the clinic which is going to free up hospital resources.”
But, he stressed, the tests were not always as reliable as those currently being used in Australia. Because rapid test kits look for antibodies associated with the virus rather than the virus itself, they could record false-negatives if used at the wrong time.
“The question is how significant those limitations are. It depends really on how many true cases you detect. Does it detect every positive, or does it miss 5%?” he said
“Because if you have to back up every test with a lab pathology test it might defeat the purpose a little bit.”
Bill Bowtell, an infectious diseases expert from the Kirby Institute, said while there was no shortage of medical supply companies looking to profit off the Covid-19 crisis, the TGA would need to consider the kits closely.
“In the end, anybody with anything to sell is in the market and their interest is to make the biggest claims,” he said.
“I think that’s the case with a lot of the things that we’ll see coming onto the market. There’s uncertainty because it didn’t come to market after stringent testing, it came to the market because there’s a feeling of ‘my god we need it’.
“In normal circumstances you wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole but this is what happens when there’s a crisis.”"

Government urges Australians overseas to return home as borders close around the world

Katharine Murphy","Advice comes as new social distancing measures are set to be unveiled after a meeting between Scott Morrison and the premiers on Tuesday night


Tue 17 Mar 2020 08.20 GMT

The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Australians to return home as soon as possible by commercial means because overseas travel is becoming “more complex and difficult” as countries impose travel restrictions and close their borders.
The new travel advice, issued on Tuesday night, triggered speculation that the Morrison government could be about to impose a lockdown in Australia. But officials told Guardian Australia that was not in contemplation.
Governments are poised to unveil new social distancing measures after a meeting between Scott Morrison and the premiers on Tuesday night. Leaders discussed additional restrictions on indoor gatherings and new measures for the aged care sector and remote Indigenous communities.
As well as the efforts to slow community transmissions of the illness, the Morrison government is also preparing a second multibillion-dollar “safety net” package. The Coalition is considering a boost to income support for welfare recipients and support for businesses at risk as a consequence of economic shock associated with the coronavirus.
While a second round of pump priming is being prepared, senior ministers on Tuesday warned the extra spending will not be enough to avoid widespread job losses stemming from the Covid-19 health crisis.
The health minister, Greg Hunt, on Tuesday also flagged a massive scaling up of public testing for the disease amid concern over test kit shortages, saying he will make a “major announcement” on the country’s testing regime on Wednesday.
According to the Department of Health, the global shortage of test kits is the reason behind the government’s decision to undertake targeted, rather than widespread testing.
The new Dfat travel advice asks Australians to reassess all overseas travel if it is non-essential, and it says: “If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means”.
Given more and more countries are closing their borders or introducing travel restrictions, Dfat advised people may not be able to return to Australia when they need to. “If you decide to return to Australia, do so as soon as possible. Commercial options may become less available,” Dfat said.
The department said the advice had been adjusted because there may be a higher risk of contracting the virus overseas and “you may come in contact with more people than usual, including during long-haul flights and in crowded airports”. It says health systems in some countries “may come under strain and may not be as well-equipped as Australia’s or have the capacity to support foreigners”.
“Overseas travel has become more complex and unpredictable. Many countries are introducing entry or movement restrictions. These are changing often and quickly. Your travel plans may be disrupted. You may be placed in quarantine or denied entry to some countries, and you may need to self-quarantine on return to Australia”.
“Think about what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities”.
As of Tuesday, there are 438 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia, with a third federal politician – the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg – among the latest to test positive to the disease.
Three senators who attended a committee hearing with Bragg last week – Jenny McAllister, Tony Sheldon and Rex Patrick – are now in self-isolation.
The rapidly escalating crisis has prompted the Coalition to hastily develop another wave of economic stimulus, which is expected to be more far-reaching than the $17.6bn package announced last week.
Federal cabinet discussed options in a meeting on Tuesday, with the measures also discussed by the cabinet’s expenditure review committee, however it is understood no final decisions have been made.
The government is looking at ways to ramp up support through existing programs and mechanisms, but the package is unlikely to be announced until after the Reserve Bank of Australia intervenes again on Thursday either through another emergency rate cut or a significant purchase of government bonds.
It is expected the government will put the new measures to a scaled-down parliament next week to be voted on before the Easter break and the May budget.
It is possible the government will also a deliver a separate assistance package for airlines in advance of unveiling the second round of stimulus either at the weekend or early next week. Qantas has signalled it will close 90% of international flights and 60% of domestic flights from the end of the month.
The government and the opposition have agreed that only 90 of the country’s 151 MPs will come to Canberra for the next parliamentary session, along with 54 of the country’s 76 senators.
The package is expected to target both heavily affected industries as well as vulnerable low-income earners.
However, even with the extra billions of dollars in government support, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, warned that the “grim reality” was that jobs would be lost as the country faced an “unprecedented” economic shutdown.
“We are very conscious that as we are looking at things today, that many businesses will close and many Australians will lose their jobs,” Cormann said on Tuesday.
“We will ensure that they have got the appropriate levels of support through this transition to the other side when there will be a strong bounce back and a strong recovery.”
The finance minister also revealed that the government was looking at specific measures to help vulnerable low-income earners, who he conceded would be hard hit by a downturn.
“We are very seriously considering what appropriate supports we can provide, in particular to the most vulnerable across our community and specifically those that are most severely impacted,” Cormann said.
“This is going to be a tough period. There will be a strong recovery on the other side, but it is going to be a tough period. We are all in this together. We are going to come up with the best possible way to get ourselves through this period.”
Amid calls for the government to do more to protect casual workers, the minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said the existing social safety net was the best delivery mechanism “for those who will need help in the challenging times ahead”.
“But however many people may require help in the challenging times ahead, because they find they are not able to work or because they have experienced unemployment due to changed economic conditions, the best assistance mechanism is the welfare system because of its proven ability to deliver income support to affected workers,” Porter told Guardian Australia.
“This is the most effective way to ensure income support reaches those in need as simply and quickly as possible, with regular waiting periods waived.”
Porter said that while the government was not considering “wholesale structural change” to the industrial relations system, those most affected needed “income support until things improve”.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, called on the government to offer more support for anyone in the workforce who has to self-isolate without access to an income – including both employees and small business people.
“Many businesses are paying to cover periods in isolation, even where there is no legal obligation to do so,” Pearson said.
“But small, family-owned businesses struggling to survive, let alone retain the staff they have, do not have the resources to support additional payments for casuals.”"

People with disabilities have had their national disability insurance scheme and other support services cancelled and been unable to get essential medication and supplies during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey by peak bodies in the sector.
A survey of 200 families conducted by Children and Young People with Disability Australia and the Australian Coalition for Inclusive Education also reveals concern about a lack of clear official advice for people with disabilities during the crisis.
Of the families with children and young people with disabilities surveyed, 82% of had not been able to buy essential supplies, 34% had NDIS or other support services cancelled and 15% were unable to buy the medication they needed.
An overwhelming majority (86%) said they were not receiving the information they needed to “keep children or young people with disability safe during the crisis”.
Mary Sayers, the chief executive of Children and Young People with Disability Australia, told Guardian Australia the government’s urgent priority should be ensuring an adequate supply of essential medicines and other supplies for children with disabilities, as well as personal protective equipment for carers.
She said disability service organisations were facing “enormous trouble with workers not turning up” and that parents and children were having support services cancelled at short notice.
One parent had told the survey their six-year-old child had lost 3kg during the crisis after a hospital appointment was cancelled.
Respondents to the survey said they were frustrated by mixed messages from education systems across the country about how social distancing would affect student support services.
Parents of children with disabilities were unsure whether to send their kids to school, where they may continue to share drinking taps and play closely with other children, she said.
Sue Tape’s daughter Eliza has Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a physical and intellectual disability that also means “respiratory bugs can really knock her about”.
Tape said there had been a “distinct lack” of clear information and advice.
“We’ve decided to self-isolate both our kids at home this week as a pre-emptive measure because there haven’t been some hard decisions made by other people,” she said.
“I can’t see any planning beyond the decisions we are personally making. By rights, both my kids could still be at school, I could still be getting on public transport and going to work.”
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.

“In the absence of information, we have to make these decisions. That is very stressful. And there are other families that don’t get to make that decision because they have to go to work.”
The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, said the government had plans in place to support NDIS participants, providers and the NDIA and “to ensure continuation of services in the case of an escalation in the incidence of Covid-19”.
“NDIS participants, families, carers and providers will be given clear direction if services are disrupted in any way, ensuring they have options to continue accessing supports,” he said.
Robert said he would meet NDIS stakeholders over the coming days “in preparation of escalation of incidence of Covid-19”.
“I am working closely with my cabinet colleagues, departments and agencies to support a coordinated approach to delivering essential services such as the NDIS to the community.”
A group of disability researchers from the universities of Melbourne, Sydney and New South Wales on Friday released a series of recommendations for the government to develop a specific response for people with disabilities during the coronavirus outbreak.
It included a call to rapidly increase the healthcare sector’s capacity to care for people with disabilities and the disability care workforce so services would remain open for those who need them.
The Disability Reform Council, which oversees the NDIS, will meet on Wednesday."

Covid-19: South Koreans keep calm and carry on testing
",Nemo Kim in Seoul,"Nation appears to be weathering coronavirus storm well with little sign of panic among public

Covid-19 testing tents are one of the few signs of activity on Seoul’s streets these days. While the number of new confirmed cases across South Korea has stayed below 100 for three days in a row, these makeshift testing centres are spearheading efforts to contain new and worrying clusters of the virus.
Outside the Koreana Building, where an insurance company call centre has produced the capital’s biggest number of infections, medical staff in protective gear work quickly, occasionally pausing to remind people queuing outside not to stand too close to each other.
No one complains about the wait, with one young man offering to change places with an older woman standing several places behind him.
Now and then, gasps can be heard from inside the tent, as another person reacts with surprise at having a swab inserted into their nostrils.
In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed in other virus-hit countries, South Koreans are, for the most part, staying calm. There have been no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing are either waiting to be tested or to buy face masks.
Since South Korea confirmed its first case of the virus on 20 January, health authorities have turned to technology, testing and social distancing in an attempt to contain the outbreak. The WHO this week urged all countries to test aggressively, citing South Korea and Taiwan’s success at limiting coronavirus infections.
But authorities remain on high alert amid new clusters of infections. A new outbreak emerged at a nursing home in the hardest-hit city of Daegu this week, with 74 positive cases, and another 55 were tied to a church south of Seoul.
The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to reassure a nervous public with daily briefings to explain how the virus has spread in the past 24 hours and what measures have been taken in response. It is, many people agree, a welcome show of transparency in uncertain times.
The practice of sending smartphone alerts informing people of an infected person’s previous movements has sparked concerns about personal privacy, however, with the Korean human rights commission advising health authorities to withhold personal information unless it is essential to containing the virus.
Technology and testing aside, some have attributed South Korea’s success in slowing the spread to avoiding minpye - causing trouble to others. That is thought to have been behind the decision by the leaders of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and River of Grace Church to apologise – albeit belatedly – for their followers’ role in spreading the virus during the early stage of the outbreak.
By retracing how someone came to be infected, South Korean authorities have been able to give the public details about new infections and identify infection clusters early on.
After an employee at the call centre tested positive, authorities quickly set up a tent to test everyone who worked or lived in the Koreana Building, as well those had visited the premises.
South Korea has tested more than 250,000 people since the outbreak began, and has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day. It has conducted 3,692 tests per million people, compared with five per million in the US.
South Korea has also pioneered “drive-thru” tests, which allow people to be tested without leaving their vehicles – a system that also means health workers do not have to disinfect the premises after each test.
One hospital in Seoul has gone a step further, developing a “walk-thru” test in which people sit inside a transparent cubicle while a medical worker collects a sample, using gloves attached to the front panel. This approach speeds up the testing process and minimises the risk to medical staff.
If a doctor suspects someone needs to be tested – if they have recently returned from China, had contact with someone known to be infected or belong to an at-risk group, for example – the procedure is done free of charge.
People who do not belong to those categories but wish to be tested are charged 160,000 won (£105) and reimbursed if the result is positive, with the government footing the bill for any treatment they receive.
In addition, people who are self-isolating, including those who have yet to test positive, each receive 454,900 won a month to cover basic living expenses.
While the government has won praise for its transparency, infected people are afraid of being stigmatised.
Ambulance drivers sent to collect people in isolation who then test positive do not switch on their sirens and park a discreet distance from their homes, so as not to alarm other residents.
“They are victims of an illness, and anyone can get infected, but some people will become alarmed if they hear the siren and discover that we’re there to collect a coronavirus patient,” Young-woo Lee, a paramedic, told the Guardian. “Some infected people have apologised to us all the way to the hospital for causing trouble.”
South Korea’s response to Covid-19 has not been seamless, however.
The health and welfare minister, Park Neung-hoo, was accused of ignoring advice on social distancing by holding a meeting of the heads of large hospitals at a restaurant in Seoul last week.
Park, who was photographed without a mask and shaking hands with 23 hospital directors, is now in self-isolation, along with seven other ministry officials, after one of the attendees was found to be infected.
“What is the point of ordinary citizens trying our best when government officials are meeting in restaurants without masks and shaking hands?” said Seoul resident Seung-Jin park, as he queued up outside a pharmacy to buy masks, purchases of which are now limited to two per week per person. “Do they have noodles for brains?”"

'We have a responsibility': Fox News declares coronavirus a crisis in abrupt U-turn
","
Adam Gabbatt","Hosts encourage viewers to practice social distancing after weeks of downplaying the pandemic as an attack on the president

Fox News, the rightwing channel that is a favorite of Donald Trump and conservatives across the US, spent the first weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak downplaying the threat of the virus.
Hosts often claimed that those warning of the danger were “panic pushers”, or engaged in “mass hysteria”. Some on Fox News even claimed it was all an effort to try to bring down the president.
But in recent days Fox News has performed an abrupt U-turn, and declared coronavirus a crisis.
On Tuesday, the three hosts of Fox & Friends, Fox News’ flagship morning program and a known favorite of Trump, co-hosted the show while practising social distancing, appearing on a split screen instead of their usual format of sitting together on a couch.
“We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Ainsley Earhardt told viewers. “So if you can keep your distance, and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly, and help our country as a nation.”
Three days earlier, Earnhardt struck a different tone, when she suggested people should take advantage of the crisis to take a trip.
“It’s actually the safest time to fly,” Earhardt had said. “Everyone I know that’s flying right now, terminals are pretty much dead – ghost towns.”

In minimizing the threat, Earhardt and her colleagues had been echoing Trump’s own response to coronavirus, which initially was to repeatedly downplay its impact. Yet one by one, Fox News hosts and personalities have fallen in line with doctors, health experts and science, in judging the coronavirus outbreak to be severe.
On 10 March Sean Hannity, Fox News’ most-watched host and a personal friend to Trump, accused the left of creating “hysteria”. He attempted to downplay Covid-19 by comparing it to the flu, and also suggested the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, was using it as an excuse to cancel rallies.
Hannity’s outlook had changed by last Friday.
“This virus is serious,” Hannity said. “We’ve been telling you that from day one. We need to take the flu seriously. We need to take cancer seriously, this virus seriously. Of course, we all need to prepare accordingly.”
There are signs that the shift is supported, or mandated, by Fox News executives. On Friday, Trish Regan’s show on Fox Business, which is owned by Fox News Media and echoes the conservative tone of the Fox News channel, was suspended after Regan offered a particularly strident avalanche of misinformation on air.
As the graphic: “Coronavirus impeachment hoax” appeared on screen, Regan claimed Democrats had created “mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off”.
Regan added: “Many in the liberal media [are] using [the] coronavirus to demonize and destroy the president.”
She also claimed the left was using “melodrama” in its response, and questioned why there was not the same response to Sars and Ebola, which she said were “far more deadly”. While they did have a higher mortality rate, only 8,000 people contracted Sars and 33,500 Ebola. As of Monday, 167,000 people have contracted Covid-19, in at least 150 countries.
“Why the melodrama?” she asked. “I’ll give you two words: Donald Trump.”
In a development that illustrates the strange times we find ourselves in, usually-controversial conservative host Tucker Carlson has been credited as one of the few Fox News personalities to treat the coronavirus seriously.
Carlson, who in the past has demonized immigrants and described white supremacy as a hoax, criticized those making light of coronavirus more than a week ago, describing it as a “major event”.
“People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem,” Carlson told viewers on 9 March, at the same time other Fox News hosts, and Trump, were doing that very thing.
“It’s just partisan politics, they say: ‘Calm down. In the end, this is just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass, and when it does, we will feel foolish for worrying about it.’
“That’s their position. But they’re wrong.”
The median age of a prime-time Fox News viewer is 66, meaning many viewers fall into the most at-risk category for complications from the coronavirus.
Carlson, who with Hannity makes up a cadre of Fox News hosts-cum-informal Trump advisers, reportedly took his concerns straight to the president earlier in March. Trump finally seemed to acknowledge the seriousness of the coronavirus on Monday, just as Fox News did the same. Whether the same sober tone lasts over the coming months remains to be seen."

Trump says 'keep politics out' of coronavirus then picks fight with Democrats

Donald Trump picked fights with Democrats on Tuesday even as he called for them to “keep politics out” of the battle against what he called, in a return to nationalist rhetoric, “the Chinese virus”.
As the White House prepares a massive stimulus package to counter the effect of the Covid-19 outbreak, the president gave an upbeat assessment of the economy, seen as critical to his political future, promising it would “pop” again soon.
“We’re going to win,” he vowed.
That this crisis is taking place in an election year is impossible to ignore.
“I watched the debate – not too exciting,” Trump said of last Sunday’s meeting between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. “But what they said about me – and we’ve done a great job – when you talk about not being bipartisan, what they said about me.”
He accused the Obama administration, in which Biden was vice-president, of making “terrible” and “horrific” mistakes in handling a swine flu outbreak in 2009.
“Seventeen thousand people died,” Trump told reporters at a coronavirus taskforce briefing. In fact the official death toll in the US was 12,469.
“They shouldn’t be criticising because we’ve done a fantastic job,” Trump added, before airing a familiar grievance.
“The only thing we haven’t done well is to get good press. We’ve done a fantastic job but it hasn’t been appreciated.
“Even the closing down of the borders, which had never been done, and not only did we close them but we closed them early. The press doesn’t like writing about it. So we’ve done a poor job on press relationships and I guess I don’t know who to blame for that. I don’t know, maybe I can blame ourselves for that. I will blame ourselves.”
In a rare Oval Office address last week, Trump urged unity. But almost every day since he has attacked Obama, Biden or Democratic governors. He began Tuesday by going after governors Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.
He tweeted: “Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.”
Trump added: “Andrew, keep politics out of it …”
New York is now among the worst affected by the coronavirus. But at a press conference in Albany, Cuomo struck a conciliatory tone: “I said to the president, who is a New Yorker … ‘I put my hand out in partnership. I want to work together 100%. I want your help. I need your help.
“I think the president was 100% sincere in saying he wanted to work together in partnership, in a spirt of cooperation. The actions he has taken evidence that. His team are on it.”
Trump also attacked Whitmer, seen as a potential running mate for Biden.
“Failing Michigan governor must work harder and be much more proactive,” he wrote. “We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!”
Whitmer shot back, seeking “swift and clear guidance, tests, personal protective equipment, and resources”. She went on to list measures taken in her state, a key election battleground.
At the White House, Trump insisted: “I only do that when I have to respond. I watched her [Whitmer] on television. She said something that was false and therefore I did do that and I will continue to do that.
“If they’re not going to play fair, because you know, they have the media on their side. I don’t. I just have me. And if they’re not going to play fair, I’m going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there’s going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of bipartisanship.”
Trump also faced criticism for his use of the phrase “Chinese virus”. Congressman Ted Lieu tweeted: “There’s a difference between saying a virus came from China versus calling it a Chinese virus. Asian Americans have already been assaulted because of this type of rhetoric.”
Asked by the Guardian if he intended to continue using the phrase, Trump replied: “China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false and rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China so I think it’s a very accurate term.”
More than a month ago, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the novel strain of the coronavirus had an official name, Covid-19, which should “prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing”.
A robust economy had been seen as Trump’s strongest suit for re-election. Now he faces recession. Airlines are said to face a bigger crisis than after 9/11.
Trump insisted: “If we do this right, our country can be rolling again pretty quickly. We have to fight that invisible enemy. I guess, unknown – but we’re getting to know it a lot better.”
He added: “The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that’s gone, it’s going to pop back like nobody’s ever seen before, that’s my opinion … I think our economy will come back really rapidly. One day we’ll be standing possibly up here, we’ll say, ‘Well, we won.’ Sure as you’re sitting here, we’re going to say that. We’re going to win.”
Trump has claimed credit for banning travel from China early on but faced condemnation for not moving faster on widespread testing. Despite a long list of public statements in which he downplayed the threat, on Tuesday he made a startling claim: “I’ve always known this is a real – this is a pandemic.
“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”"

Wed 18 Mar 2020 11.00 GMT


In some of the most dangerously overcrowded Greek refugee camps, it has become a race against time to raise awareness about Covid-19 and ensure an outbreak does not spread among an already vulnerable population.
In the infamous Moria camp on the island of Lesbos close to 20,000 people live in a space designed for just under 3,000.
There is is already limited access to running water in the camp, and toilets and showers regularly block due to overuse. The first case of Covid-19 was confirmed on the island last week when a Greek woman from the town of Plomari tested positive. So far this the only confirmed case on the island.
There is an increasing sense of urgency in Moria about hygiene and handwashing. In the absence of support from the Greek authorities, residents are taking matters into their own hands.
“The conditions were out of control and so we knew that we needed to do something by ourselves,” said Deen Mohammad Alizadah, 30, originally from Afghanistan.
Alizadah is one of the residents who have come together to create an awareness team. “The only thing that can control the virus here is the management of people and making them aware,” he said.
The members of the team are a snapshot of the diverse population of Moria, heralding from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and the Congo region, each dispensing advice to their own communities. The team has already swelled to 50 people, with more joining by the day. Megaphones are being distributed to help spread the word about the importance of hygiene and washing.
Due to high demand, face masks are currently in short supply in pharmacies in the local town of Mytilene, and since there is no current mass distribution of masks to the camp, industrious Moria residents have come up with their own solution. 
In a small building around a kilometre from Moria, a group of four Afghan women have volunteered their time to sew face masks for the camp’s population. Stand By Me Lesvos, a Greek NGO, realised that they could make use of the sewing machines from a previous project. 
“It was set up within six hours on Friday,” said Mixalis Avialotis from Stand By Me Lesvos. “One of the Afghan women used to be a tailor in Kabul and said she’d have no problem managing the operation.” 
The women are working at a rapid rate and in their first day made approximately 500 masks, which are fashioned from cotton fabric bought from local shops. The masks are then packaged into plastic wrappers purchased from the local Lidl supermarket and boxed to be brought to the camp. The masks, which will be given out for free, will initially only be distributed to camp residents who start to feel unwell or exhibit symptoms of the virus, such as a cough.
Once worn, the masks will then be boiled and sterilised so that, if necessary, they can be reused.
Avialotis estimates that they have now made around 1,500 masks and said that social distancing and other Covid-19-mitigating measures have also been implemented inside the factory.“
On the island of Samos where the refugee camp hosts nearly 7,500 people in a space designed for 648, conditions are similarly cramped. Huddled on a hill above the town of Samos, the island’s capital, washing facilities are scarce. Around 400 of the thousands of people living here are unaccompanied minors, some of whom have already have skin conditions such as chronic scabies due to poor sanitary conditions.
Guilia Cicoli, co-founder of Still I Rise NGO, which runs a youth centre for children living in Vathy camp, told the Guardian that they had spent a lot of time speaking to the children about Covid-19. The children have also produced posters about hand washing and hygiene in class.
“Most of us are Italians so we took it very seriously and started awareness raising before Greece even had any confirmed cases,” she said. “Before we had to close last week we had already replaced handshakes with elbow or feet bumps.”
Movement on the Ground, a Dutch NGO, started taping dispensers of hand sanitiser to olive trees in Samos last week to encourage residents to regularly wash their hands in the dusty and dirty conditions.
The impending threat of the virus has pushed some camp residents from Moria to seek refuge on the mainland. The Guardian knows of a number of them, some with sick family members, who decided that they could not wait for a UNHCR-organised ferry to the mainland and made their own way Athens last week after the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Lesbos.
This decision has left them without access to accommodation and any state provision. Yet for the families, leaving the camps seems like the safer option as many see a Covid-19 outbreak there as inevitable."

‘Social recession’: how isolation can affect physical and mental health

Adam Gabbatt","As countries across the globe hunker down, long-term isolation can have profound physical and psychological effects


Wed 18 Mar 2020 08.00 GMT

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, millions of people in the US are coming to terms with being increasingly cut off from society.
Beyond the inconvenience of working from home, or not being able to go to bars, restaurants or cinemas, however, experts have found that social-isolation can have a profound effect on people’s physical, as well as mental health.
Long-term, isolation even increases the risk of premature death. It’s being called a “social recession” to match any economic downturn also caused by the growing pandemic and it can have profound physical and psychological effects.
“People who are more socially connected show less inflammation, conversely people who are more isolated and lonely show more increased chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in a variety of chronic diseases,” said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University.
“We also have evidence that this is linked to cardiovascular function like blood pressure, heart rate, circulating stress hormones. It’s been linked to even cellular aging.”
Bars and restaurants have been ordered closed in at least 11 states, including California, Illinois and New York, while more than 30 states have closed down schools. On Monday people in six counties in northern California were given a mandatory to stay at home, one of the strictest measures yet in the US. France had already issued a lockdown which will only allow people to make trips to supermarkets, pharmacies and their workplaces – should working from home not be an option, while Germany has closed places of worship, playgrounds and non-essential shops.
As countries across the globe hunker down, Holt-Lunstad’s research presents a stark look at what social isolation over a period of years can do to the body. She examined data from across the globe to study the effects of people being socially isolated or lonely, or living alone.
Loneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social-isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%
“Each of these significantly predict risk for premature death,” Holt-Lunstad said.
“Loneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social-isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%.”
Holt-Lunstad didn’t find that one cause of death was more prevalent than another. The risk of every cause of death – including heart disease, cancer, stroke, renal failure – increased from isolation.
A period of a few weeks in isolation should not lead to the inflammation and risk of cardiovascular trouble that Holt-Lunstad described. People could still see an impact on their health, however.
“We do have evidence that these [periods of shorter isolation] can have immediate and short-term kinds of effects on our physiology. But, for instance, if your blood pressure is elevated acutely, that’s going to have a different kind of an effect than if your blood pressure’s elevated chronically,” Holt-Lunstad said.
“For those with underlying pre-existing conditions, those acute elevations might precipitate some sort of acute event. But for most of rest of us, who may not have some kind of underlying condition, we hope that this would just be acute and wouldn’t have these long-term effects.”
One of the reasons people can suffer in social-isolation is because personal relationships can help us cope with stress, Holt-Linstad said.
“For instance: the ongoing uncertainty of what’s going on right now in the world, your body’s response to that may differ. Depending on the extent to which you feel like you have the resources you need to cope with that. And that in large part may be dependent on whether or not you feel like you have others in your life you can rely on. That you’ve got someone who has your back or you can count on, or you can get through it together.”
Dhruv Khullar, a physician and researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said short periods of isolation can cause increase anxiety or depression “within days”.
“We have evolved to be social creatures. For all the history of humanity, people have been in family structures, people have been in groups, we’re evolved to kind of crave and rely on that interaction with other human beings,” Khullar said.
“So when we don’t have that it’s a huge void in the way that we go about being human. This is something that has been kind of hard-wired into who we are as beings.”
Khullar, who stressed the crackdown on social gatherings was necessary, said 
people do at least have a wealth of options to stay connected. Texting, video calling or even the phone could potentially help avert the sense of isolation or loneliness, Khullar said.
“Tech isn’t a perfect substitute. Physical contact, being face to face with people, there’s all sorts of subtle social cues that we pick up on that we rely on, that are ingrained in us over generations and millennia,” he said.
“But I do think you can get part of the way there by engaging with others digitally. I think the richer the format, probably the better – so a phone call is better than a text, a video conference is probably better than a phone call.”
Older people, who are more at risk of Covid-19, may be less technologically savvy, and may have fewer connections to begin with. They might not be able to video conference or even send a text message. Khullar said it was important to reassure them that help is at hand.
“Let’s look out for the people that are most vulnerable,” Khullar said.
“Make sure that you’re reaching out to them to make sure that they’re doing OK, that they understand that there are people still looking out for them that they’re bonded with, that they’re connected with.”"

Coronavirus fears and controversial passport sales: Vanuatu's election explained
",Tess Newton Cain,"A country with fractured and shifting political alliances, Vanuatu heads to the polls at a crucial moment in its history 


Tue 17 Mar 2020 21.00 GMT

In the coffee shops and kava bars of Vanuatu’s capital of Port Vila, there are two subjects that dominate conversation: Covid-19 and this week’s general elections, which will be held on Thursday.
Vanuatu, a south Pacific nation just a three-hour flight from Australia, has a population of just under 300,000. It is often thought of as a politically unstable nation, with shifting political allegiances, seemingly based more on expediency than ideology.
In 2015, 14 members of parliament, including the acting prime minister, were found guilty of corruption, putting half the governing party’s MPs behind bars. The last elections were held in January 2016 and there has been one prime minister, Charlot Salwai, since then.
The 2020 elections come at a key time for Vanuatu, which this year marks its 40th anniversary of independence from joint rule by France and the United Kingdom. It is also scheduled to host the next meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders – the most significant regional diplomatic event – in August, and is scheduled to graduate from “least-developed” status by the end of the year.
From a field of almost 240 candidates, the people of Vanuatu will elect 52 MPs to sit in parliament. The prime minister will be elected by the entire house when it sits later this year.
Vanuatu politics is fractured and complex. After the 2016 elections there were 17 parties represented in the parliament, but none of them secured more than six seats and coalition governments have been a feature of the Vanuatu political scene for quite some time and that is unlikely to change this year.
While long-established parties such as the Vanua’aku Pati (VP) and the United Moderates Party (UMP) will no doubt have a presence in the new parliament, newer groupings such as Salwai’s Reunification Movement for Change (RMC) and the Leaders Party of Vanuatu, led by the outgoing deputy prime minister Jotham Napat, are expected to feature strongly.
The profile of political candidates in Vanuatu has evolved over the years. Back in 1980, when Father Walter Lini became the first prime minister, the political leadership was largely made up of pastors and senior members of churches.
Now, Vanuatu’s parliament is increasingly a gathering of technocrats. At this election, a large number of former public servants have thrown their hats into the ring, as well as a number of candidates from the private sector.
There has not been a woman elected to parliament since 2008 and Vanuatu is one of just three countries in the world not to have any women in its parliament (the other two – Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia – are also in the Pacific). This year around 15 women are contesting, including prominent human rights campaigner and former nurse, Anne Pakoa.
In Vanuatu, political parties tend to come together around personalities or family and kinship allegiances rather than political ideology. There is no left/right or conservative/progressive divide as such and different parties’ policy platforms often look very similar.
A contentious issue at this year’s election is the future of Vanuatu’s lucrative but controversial citizenship by investment, or “passport sales” programmes. These schemes have allowed applicants to become citizens in months, without setting foot in the country, for a price of around $US150,000.
The Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper found that 1,800 passports were sold in 2018 alone, making passport sales the single largest source of revenue for the Vanuatu government.
But away from the city, people are likely to vote for those they think will be able to meet their immediate needs, says Linda Kenni, a development consultant in Vanuatu who works in rural parts of the country.
“Some people vote because of the party… some vote for material things. They want to vote for people who will think of them when they win with material things like food items, solar lights and saucepans,” she says.
At the last election, voter turnout was 57%, and there are concerns that people’s fears of Covid-19, of which there have bene no confirmed cases in Vanuatu so far, will present an additional hurdle to overcome.
The director-general of the ministry of internal affairs has urged people to vote and said there will be hand sanitiser at polling stations in an effort to provide some reassurance to people who might otherwise stay away.
Once the elections are done, it will likely be a few weeks before there is certainty about what the leadership of Vanuatu will look like.
Whoever takes the reins will have a number of challenges to address including dealing with the immediate and longer-term impacts of the new coronavirus, about which there is huge fear across the entire Pacific region, determining whether big events such as independence celebrations and the Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting can proceed and the future of the nation."

How Australia will enforce coronavirus self-isolation rules for overseas arrivals

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Australia has introduced mandatory 14-day self-isolation for people arriving from overseas. But how will this be enforced?
Under the NSW Public Health Act, anyone who enters Australia from another country will be subject to a 14-day self-isolation quarantine, with fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ prison if they do not comply.
“Obviously the NSW government – indeed all governments around the country – are not wanting to impose penalties on people,” health minister Brad Hazzard said. “What we’re looking for is cooperation.”
The order banning mass gatherings of more than 500 people to stem the spread of coronavirus has also been made under the Public Health Act, with fines of up to $55,000 for corporations who breach that ban and $27,500 for each additional day the event continues.
The order explicitly excludes gatherings including the ordinary operation of a school, university, Tafe and educational college; the ordinary conduct of a court; public transport; and employees attending a workplace. It will remain in place until 14 June.
The Victorian government enacted a four-week state of emergency under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008, extending from 12pm Monday to midnight 13 April unless extended.
The state of emergency declaration gives authorised officers, such as police, at the direction of the chief health officer, the power to detain people, restrict movement, prevent entry to premises or provide “any other direction an [authorised officer] considers reasonable to protect public health”.
Under the directive signed by the chief health officer, it is an offence for a person arriving from overseas to fail to go into self-isolation for 14 days. People must not leave the premises where they are self-isolating except for the purpose of obtaining medical care or supplies; in any other emergency situation; or in circumstances where it is possible to avoid close contact with other persons. They also cannot allow visitors into their home.
The penalty for failing to comply is a fine of almost $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for companies.
“We don’t anticipate having to be fining people,” Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said on Monday. “To this point people have been cooperative.”
Flight attendants and citizens or permanent residents of a Pacific Island are exempt.
The same directive bans mass gatherings of more than 500 people, exempting schools, airports, public transport, markets, workplaces, courts, prisons and youth justice facilities, parliament and public places where people are moving through, such as Bourke Street Mall and Federation Square.
Andrews said the powers could be extended to include the lockdown of whole suburbs.
People arriving in Queensland from overseas will be issued with a notice requesting them to voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days. If they breach that notice, the Queensland government says it will “initially work closely with the person to ensure they not only understand their obligations, but also the importance and seriousness of self-quarantine under the current global circumstances”.
If that fails, the notice is enforceable under the Public Health Act 2005 with fines of up to $13,345.
Queensland has been in a state of emergency since late January and can use those powers to enforce compliance if necessary – but it has repeatedly stated that it is aiming for willing community cooperation.
The ACT declared a public health emergency on Monday in response to Covid-19, which gives the chief health officer powers to enforce quarantine provisions, to order the evacuations of public areas, to restrict access to an area, and even to force someone to undergo medical examination.
Under those powers, anyone who breaches the order for travellers to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Australia could face a $8,000 fine, under the Public Health Act 1997.
Mass gatherings will be policed under the same legislation.
Western Australian invoked powers under the Emergency Management Act at midnight on Sunday to enforce self-isolation requirements.
Under the act, travellers who breach the 14-day self-isolation order are liable for a $50,000 fine or possible jail time.
The ban against mass gatherings is enforced under the same legislation, with the same penalty to apply.
Self-isolation requirements will be enforced under the Notifiable Diseases Act, which carries penalties of $1,256 or six months’ prison for breaching a public health order.
Di Stevens, the acting chief health officer, said she expected the community would monitor and police each other to ensure isolation orders were followed.
Mass gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned under the Public and Environmental Health Act.
That does not include schools, universities, public transport or attending the Darwin markets, chief minister Michael Gunner said.
Travel to remote communities for everyone but essential services, supply runs and maintenance runs has also been banned. Gunner said people in remote communities were not being “left alone” during the coronavirus outbreak and would have everything they needed to be healthy and safe.
“To protect you, we are keeping nonessential people away from you,” he said. “If you don’t need to travel out of your community, then don’t. Just like the rest of us you are safer in your home community.”
South Australia declared a public health emergency on Sunday. Premier Steven Marshall told AAP the declaration would allow public health officers to take “all the necessary actions required to keep the people of South Australia as safe as we possibly can”.
The SA parliament this month passed new laws giving public health officers greater powers to order a person to self-isolate, be detained in a particular place or agree to medical testing.
Failure to comply with orders under the revised Public Health Act 2011 carries a maximum fine of $25,000.
Tasmania was the first state to ban cruise ships from coming into port, and introduced measures banning mass gatherings of more than 500 people, and requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days, from midnight on Sunday.
Under the Public Health Act in Tasmania, the maximum fine for breaching an order to self-isolate is $8,400.
The ban on mass gatherings does not include markets, like Hobart’s Salamanca market, on the justification that those events involve people moving through and are therefore unlikely to result in someone having sustained close contact with a stranger. However school fetes and assemblies have been banned."

Iran reported its single biggest jump in deaths from the new coronavirus on Wednesday, saying that another 147 had died in a nearly 15% spike that raises the death toll to 1,135 people nationwide, the Associated Press reports:
It marks the biggest 24-hour rise in deaths since officials first acknowledged cases of the virus in Iran in mid-February.
The rise in deaths comes as the number of cases continues to grow each day, with some 17,361 people having been infection nationwide, according to a briefing Wednesday by Irans deputy health minister, Alireza Raisi.
The outbreak has cast a shadow over the Persian New Year, Nowruz, a normally joyous holiday that begins on Friday. Health officials have urged the public to avoid travel and crowded places. But many seem to be ignoring the warnings, raising the risk of further outbreaks.

Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, has asked the country’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to stop illegal trading and consumption of wildlife over fears it spreads disease. 
Here is an extract:
The directive, seen as a victory for animal rights organisations, will lead to a clamping down on street-side markets dotted across the country, increase prosecutions of online traders and ideally put pressure on thousands of farms with known links to illegal wildlife trading.
Vitenam’s move to ban the wildlife trade follows similar moves by the Chinese government, after the new coronavirus pandemic appeared to have emerged from a wet market in Wuhan.

EasyJet has put all its flights for autumn and next winter on sale early – for a flat fare of £29.99 – even during Christmas and school holiday peaks, writes the Guardian’s transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham.
The airline said the move will give more scope to passengers who had booked flights for the next couple of months to find alternatives, without any charges to change existing bookings (or to rebook should the crisis persist).
The extraordinary step could provide particularly good deals for people booking in the next week for peak season – and perhaps a glimmer of optimism for some normality ahead.
EasyJet will hope it generates some revenues and forward bookings at a time when demand has vanished and airlines await details of the chancellor’s promised package of help, with the industry warning that most airlines worldwide could go bankrupt by the end of May.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has defended his government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Associated Press reports. 
The Iranian government has faced widespread criticism that officials acted too slowly and may have even covered up initial cases before infections rapidly spread across the country.
AP reports:
Iran has been the hardest hit country in the region, with nearly 1,000 dead and roughly 90% of the over 18,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the Middle East. Its leadership announced Tuesday that millions could die in the Islamic Republic if people keep traveling and ignore health guidance.
In a speech to his Cabinet, Rouhani said the government was straightforward” with the nation, saying it announced the outbreak as soon as it learned about it on Feb. 19. “We spoke to people in a honest way. We had no delay, he added.
The government has come under heavy criticism for what has been seen as a slow and inadequate response. For weeks, government officials implored clerics to shut down crowded holy shrines to stymie the spread of the virus. The government finally closed the shrines this week.
“It was difficult of course to shut down mosques and holy sites, but we did it. It was a religious duty to do it”, Rouhani said.
The outbreak has cast a shadow over the Persian New Year, Nowruz, a normally joyous holiday that begins on Friday. Health officials have urged the public to avoid travel and crowded places. But many seem to be ignoring the warnings, raising the risk of further outbreaks. 
Some food markets in the capital, Tehran, were still packed on Wednesday, and highways were crowded with traffic as families traveled between cities. Iran also announced it would close mosques for communal Friday prayers for a third consecutive week. Other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have also cancelled Friday prayers in mosques.

Estonia and Latvia have pledged to send ships to bring home hundreds of their citizens stranded on the German-Polish border, after Poland closed its borders last week to prevent the spread of coronavirus, writes my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. 
Estonia and Latvia promise to send ships to bring home hundreds of their citizens stranded on the German-Polish border via @Reuters
Citing official sources, Reuters said the countries were organising cruise ships and ferries to bring their citizens home via Baltic ports later on Wednesday and next week. The Lithuanian government estimates that 420 vehicles with Lithuanian number plates were stuck at the German-Polish border on Monday. 
Under EU law, countries are allowed to introduce border controls during emergency situations, but are obliged to allow their own citizens to enter and citizens of other EU countries to pass through on their way home. 
Following talks with 27 EU leaders via video link on Tuesday, the head of the European commission Ursula von der Leyen said it was “absolutely crucial that we unblock the situation, because we know that too many people are stranded within the European Union”.
As lorries queue at the EU’s internal borders, prompting concern about the supply of food and medical goods, von der Leyen also urged states to follow new guidelines to ensure the swift flow of supplies.
The flow of goods has to be swift. We need these goods for the functioning of the internal market. 
She was speaking after EU leaders approved a ban on non-EU citizens coming into the union. EU member states will now have to enforce the 30-day ban, which includes exemptions for British nationals, EU citizens and family members returning home, healthcare workers and researchers, diplomats and people transporting goods.

Two UN agencies have announced that refugees will no longer be resettled to homes in safe countries, as the world battles the Covid-19 crisis, writes my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels.
Two UN agencies are suspending refugee resettlement as ""a temporary measure"" because of Covid-19Meanwhile NGOs warn that support services for refugees are closing, volunteer numbers falling - via @lorenzo_tondo https://t.co/LJ7Rv1LttY
In a joint statement, the UN refugee agency (the UNHCR) and the UN migration agency (the IOM), said refugee resettlement would be suspended as “a temporary measure that will be in place only for as long as it remains essential”.
As more countries have introduced travel restrictions and frozen refugee resettlement programmes, the two agencies had little choice. They also raised concern that international travel could increase the exposure of refugees to the virus.
In 2019, the UNHCR helped more than 63,600 refugees find a life in a new country, including people who had fled Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Somalia. In the previous year, the IOM helped nearly 95,000 people find a new home, whether through a resettlement programme to a safe country, or some other humanitarian scheme.
The decision comes after rights groups warned that refugees and migrants - especially unaccompanied minors - need urgent help. The charities are deeply concerned about the fate of 36,000 asylum seekers on five Greek islands, who are sheltering in squalid, overcrowded camps, often lacking electricity, heating and hot water.

Belgium is the latest country to go into lockdown, with citizens asked to stay at home and limit contact to their closest family, writes Jennifer Rankin. 
From noon local time (CET), all non-essential shops and open-air markets will close and people will be expected to work at home. 
Employers who require staff to be on site but cannot ensure social distancing face fines and even closure.
The measures are similar to those adopted by France24 hours earlier, but looser. People will be able to visit supermarkets, pharmacies, medical professionals, banks, post offices and bookshops.
Supermarkets must limit the number of customers to one per 10 square metres, meaning people are likely to have to queue outside, where they must also observe social distancing by standing well apart. 
Going out for a walk or a run, or riding a bike is allowed, “even encouraged”, the authorities say, as long as people observe a distance of one and a half metres from anyone who is not a member of their household.
The restrictions, which are unprecedented in peacetime, were agreed on Tuesday night by Belgium’s national security council, which includes the prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, deputy prime ministers, other senior politicians and the security services.

Wilmès, appointed by the king on Monday to form a permanent government, after 15 months of caretaker administrations, said social distancing did not have to mean no social contact, stressing the role technology could play to keep people together.
She said:
These decisions were not taken lightly and were taken because we are obliged to by the evolving situation. Success in our struggle against Covid-19 is inextricably linked to the efforts of each person.
Belgium has had 1,085 cases of Covid-19 and 10 people have died, according to the latest figures in Belgian media.

From its release: 
In these unprecedented and challenging times, BaptistCare have taken precautions to prioritise the safety and health of our residents, families and staff.
Older Australians are especially vulnerable to this virus, and it is vital we take additional measures to protect our residents and staff as the transmission of COVID-19 continues to escalate in the community.
This is a preventative measure only and there is currently no other case of COVID-19 at any other BaptistCare home.
 The preventative closure to all visitors means:
 We are assessing this developing situation in an ongoing way, and we will advise residents and families as soon as anything changes.
 We understand how difficult this will be for many of our families, and even for our residents who look forward to visits from their loved ones, however we appreciate all cooperation at this time as we do all we can to protect our residents and staff.

From AAP:
An aged care service provider has moved to bar all visitors from its homes to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
It’s a step up from new measures introduced by the federal government, which would limit visits to aged care facilities to short, two-person visits once a day.
Anyone who has been overseas in the past two weeks, been in contact with someone who has coronavirus or respiratory infection symptoms will be barred completely.
The changes are part of a range of measures announced by the prime minister and chief medical officer on Wednesday.
These include warning Australians against all overseas travel and banning non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people.
An email from Estia chief executive Ian Thornley to family and friends of residents said its facilities would close to visitors from 5pm on Wednesday.
“We understand that this decision will have significant impact on our residents and their close contacts and sincerely apologise for this,” he said in the email seen by AAP.
Visitors would still be allowed in “exceptional circumstances on compassionate grounds” with volunteers also to be barred from Estia homes and non-essential resident outings banned.
Estia is a commercial aged care provider running nearly 70 residences in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.

Medical authorities in China have said a drug used in Japan to treat new strains of influenza appeared to be effective in coronavirus patients, Japanese media said on Wednesday.
Zhang Xinmin, an official at China’s science and technology ministry, said favipiravir, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm, had produced encouraging outcomes in clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen involving 340 patients.
“It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,” Zhang told reporters on Tuesday.
Patients who were given the medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virus after a median of four days after becoming positive, compared with a median of 11 days for those who were not treated with the drug, public broadcaster NHK said.
In addition, X-rays confirmed improvements in lung condition in about 91% of the patients who were treated with favipiravir, compared to 62% or those without the drug.
Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, which developed the drug – also known as Avigan – in 2014, has declined to comment on the claims.
Shares in the firm surged on Wednesday following Zhang’s comments, closing the morning up 14.7% at 5,207 yen, having briefly hit their daily limit high of 5,238 yen.
Doctors in Japan are using the same drug in clinical studies on coronavirus patients with mild to moderate symptoms, hoping it will prevent the virus from multiplying in patients.
But a Japanese health ministry source suggested the drug was not as effective in people with more severe symptoms. “We’ve given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn’t seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,” the source told the Mainichi Shimbun.
The same limitations had been identified in studies involving coronavirus patients using a combination of the HIV antiretrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir, the source added.
In 2016, the Japanese government supplied favipiravir as an emergency aid to counter the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea.
Favipiravir would need government approval for full-scale use on Covid-19 patients, since it was originally intended to treat flu.
A health official told the Mainichi the drug could be approved as early as May. “But if the results of clinical research are delayed, approval could also be delayed.”"

Scott Morrison has told Australians to “stop hoarding” as he announces sweeping new measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, a global do-not-travel order, and strict new rules for visiting aged care homes.
In a massive step-up of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, the prime minister announced that a national cabinet of state and federal leaders had agreed on Tuesday night to an indefinite new ban on indoor groups of 100 people or more, with exemptions for schools, public transport, universities, prisons, courts, supermarkets and worksites.
The new measure, to be effective immediately, comes after a ban on mass gatherings of more than 500 people was put in place on Monday, prompting the widespread cancellation of sporting and cultural events.
While declaring a national human biosecurity emergency under the Biosecurity Act on Tuesday morning, Morrison ruled out an Italian-style national lockdown and urged calm, taking aim at those panic buying, saying it was “un-Australian” and unnecessary.
“Stop hoarding,” he said. “I can’t be more blunt about it. Stop it. It is not sensible, it is not helpful and it has been one of the most disappointing things I have seen in Australian behaviour in response to this crisis.
“That is not who we are as a people. It is not necessary. It is not something that people should be doing.”
The declaration under the act, which was signed off by the governor general on Tuesday morning, allows a minister to “determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary” to prevent entry or spread of a disease, with penalties for non-compliance.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has also announced level-four restrictions for all global travel, with formal advice now escalated to “do not travel overseas”, along with a call for Australians abroad to return home or risk being stranded.
Warning that the measures were likely to be in place for at least six months, Morrison stridently defended the government’s decision to keep schools open, saying that 30% of the health workforce could be disrupted if schools were shut, and jobs would be lost, with limited health benefits.
“The disruption that would occur from the closure of schools around this country, make no mistake, would be severe,” Morrison said.
“What do I mean by severe? Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more. [There would be] a 30% impact on the availability of health workers is our advice – that will put peoples’ lives at risk.”
“There is a national public interest here in keeping schools open and our advice is that is not being done at the detriment at the health of any child.”
He also said he would be sending his children to school and was happy to do so.
“There is only one reason your kids shouldn’t be going to school and that is if they are unwell,” he said.
The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, also emphasised that the virus behaved differently among young people, but said schools would still need to encourage hand-washing, practise social distancing and limit group gatherings.
“It will be hard for schools, but it would be much, much, much harder for society if the schools were closed.”
The national cabinet has also agreed to a range of restrictions on aged care home visits, including by those who have been overseas or exposed to the virus, those who have any respiratory illness or display symptoms, and school groups.
There will also be limits on social gatherings for aged care residents, and social distancing measures will be put in place.
For end-of-life situations, Morrison said arrangements would be made on a case-by-case basis, in negotiation with care facilities.
“In cases of end of life, I know that people will want to see their elderly parents or relatives or others. I totally understand that. Aged care facilities will have the discretion to put in very strict arrangements to enable people to visit their loved ones if that is the situation that that resident finds themselves in.”
Amid concern about the potential of the virus to take hold in vulnerable remote Indigenous communities, Morrison said a list of proscribed areas that would limit visitation was also being prepared by the states.
Anzac Day events and ceremonies will also be cancelled due to the higher proportion of older Australians who attend such events.
Ruling out a short-term lockdown of the country, which Murphy claimed would “achieve nothing”, Morrison warned that the measures being taken by the government would likely be in place for at least half a year.
“We are looking at a situation of at least six months for how we deal with this,” Morrison said. “It could be much longer than that. It could be shorter. That is unlikely, given the way we are seeing events unfold.”
“What we are doing, you have to be able to keep doing that and sustain that, that has to be something that is achievable for all Australians so we can keep our country running in the best possible way in the interests of all Australians.”
With 454 confirmed cases now in Australia, Murphy said the government was unsure of the current trajectory, but said there was now low-level “community transition” that would see the number of cases rise.
He emphasised the importance of social distancing and hand hygiene, urging Australians to “keep away from each other where possible”.
“No more hand shaking. No more hugging … no more scant attention to hand hygiene.”
Along with the health measures, Morrison said the government was finalising a second economic assistance package which would be focused on improving the “safety net” for affected businesses and individuals.
“The government is considering quite extensively further economic measures that will deal with the strength and the strengthening of our safety net and cushioning the even greater impact of the coronavirus on the Australian economy,” Morrison said.
“Last week we focused very much on the stimulus-type activity, encouraging investment, encouraging demand into the economy and providing support to small business. The measures that we are focusing on now are of a different nature – they are focused more on the cushioning impact of the safety net for individuals and small businesses.”
The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the opposition was inclined to support the economic stimulus package when it came before parliament next week.
“We will be supportive, make no mistake, of economic stimulus,” Albanese said.
But he said there was “urgency” to roll out health and economic measures as soon as possible, and called for more assistance for the aviation industry on top of a $715m package outlined on Wednesday.
“We know that the sooner the response, the more effective it will be and the less the cost will be in the long run,” he said."

Josh Taylor","A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia


Wed 18 Mar 2020 10.07 GMT


Last modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 10.54 GMT


Key Australian developments in the global coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday include:
New South Wales announced the sixth death in Australia from coronavirus after an 86-year-old man died in a Sydney hospital overnight.
There are now 539 cases of coronavirus in Australia. NSW had its biggest spike in daily cases, with 57 new cases recorded, while Victoria recorded 27 new cases.
The national cabinet agreed to restrict gatherings indoors to less than 100 people, adding to the ban on gatherings of over 500 people outdoors.
For the first time, the federal government has advised Australians not to travel overseas at all.
Domestic travel is still allowed, but state governments have been asked to implement strict cleaning rules for public transport.
Anzac Day services have been cancelled, but a televised dawn service will still occur at the Australian War Memorial, without an audience.
New restrictions on aged care facilities will limit visit durations and only allow two at a time per day. Children under 16 are banned except in exceptional circumstances.
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also condemned people panic buying in bulk, stating it was not necessary.
The Australian stock market wiped out the gains it made on Tuesday, dropping more than 6% on Wednesday. The ASX has now shed 30% of its value since 21 February.
The Australian dollar dropped to a 17-year low, falling under 60 US cents.
The federal government will waive government charges, including fuel excise and air services charges for domestic and regional operations, in a package worth $715m, with $159m to be reimbursed for charges paid since the start of February.
The Red Cross says it needs about 14,000 donors to prevent a shortage as we enter cold and flu season, and the possibility that coronavirus could cause more shortages of the regular supply from donors.
The Virgin Australia CEO, Paul Scurrah, announced Virgin would ground its international fleet from the end of this month until mid-June at the earliest, and cut domestic flights by 50% in response to softening demand.
Scurrah said job losses at the airline were inevitable, but Virgin was working through it.
“What we’re working through now is how that impact can be shared, how it can lessen the long-term impact on people and we’re talking with our people directly and the unions to make sure that that impact is minimised,” he said.
“Part of what they have volunteered up is people willing to take leave without pay, people willing to go from full-time to part-time. People willing to job share and that is the incredible people we have working here.”
In compliance with the new indoor restrictions, a number of religious organisations including the Catholic archdioscese of Melbourne and the Anglican church in Sydney announced they would suspend services until further notice. Palace Cinemas also announced its 17 cinemas would close from tomorrow in compliance with the rule.
The Sydney film and comedy festivals were also cancelled.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to make a monetary policy announcement on Thursday, likely around interest rates or quantitive easing, as Australia is tipped to go into recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
The federal government is expected to wait for the RBA’s announcement on Thursday before announcing its second stimulus package, likely before the weekend. The package will be announced before parliament returns (at a reduced capacity) to pass both stimulus packages.
Morrison said the second stimulus would focus on the impact the strict travel and social distancing policies would have on the economy.
“The task of this next set of measures is really about trying to cushion the impact. I can’t understate the significance of the gear change that occurred last weekend. The gear change, when we were moving to far more widespread social distancing and bans on gatherings and all of this, this has a much more profound impact on the economy.”
The $65m package includes $10,000 for businesses for shop fitouts; another $10,000 for businesses that match that spend; $5m for immediate works; $50,000 for clubs, community organisations and not-for-profits for renovations; $30m for the return of the home investment scheme; and a suspension on government fees, charges and electricity prices until July 2021."

Thousands of Australians have been left stranded overseas as airlines cancel flights and countries across the globe shut their borders entirely in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19.
Australians caught by closed borders, airport shutdowns, cancelled flights or soaring ticket prices say they are trying to heed the government’s advice to return home for the duration of the pandemic, but can’t.
At least 100 Australians are isolated in Peru after the government in Lima closed all borders and land crossings and stopped international flights in and out.
Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) has advised all Australians to return home as soon as possible on commercial flights, but has conceded that for some getting back is currently impossible.
The Australian embassy in Lima is closed. In a note to Australians in Peru, Dfat said: “Movement is heavily restricted and Peru’s borders are closed. It is not possible to leave at this time.
“If you’re in Peru remain where you are. Follow the instructions of local authorities. Take care to minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.”
Amy Neilson, a Tasmanian doctor currently in Lima, said she was concerned about a lack of government guidance or assistance for stranded Australians. She said that she, along with others in Peru, were compiling a list of Australians in the country.
“I’m advised the Canadian embassy is trying to make a list of people in Peru on lockdown in the state of emergency. Why is Australia not doing this?” 
Neilson said she tried to get out of Peru days ago, but there were no flights available for days ahead.
“I have a flight booked for the 20th [of March] but it is unlikely to go ahead. Reports are that there are army/police at the airport and you can’t get in without a boarding pass. Also reports of people on floors with nowhere to go.
“People have come from the airport as no flights are leaving any more. People are reporting difficulty getting a taxi as movement is legally limited to the shops or doctors.”
Jorga Gec, an architect from Melbourne, told Guardian Australia there wasn’t enough time to get out of Peru.
“We woke up Monday morning to be told Peru were closing the borders at 11pm that day. We had a flight booked at 7am on Tuesday morning and a connecting flight out to Australia from Santiago, but it was too late.
“We spent most of the day at the airport trying to get a flight out. Hopeless – all flights were already booked out. We were hoping Latam [Airlines] would schedule more flights to help get people out, but they were cancelling flights.”
Other travellers in Peru have said their efforts to contact Dfat have failed, and with the embassy closed for 15 days there has been no official advice on what they should do. Some have even been unable to register their presence overseas with Dfat.
The Peruvian government has announced humanitarian charter flights – run by governments seeking to repatriate their citizens – would be available over the next few days. Guardian Australia has asked the office of the foreign minister whether there are plans to do the same for stranded Australians.
Late on Tuesday, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, said: “Transport options will likely become more limited as countries respond to the Covid-19 outbreak and Dfat’s capacity to provide consular help may be limited.”
On Wednesday, the department raised Australia’s travel advisory to its highest level: “regardless of your destination, age or health, our advice is do not travel at this time”.
Guardian Australia has been contacted by dozens of Australians caught overseas: in Kenya, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, the US, UK, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Hungary, even en route to Antarctica, seeking passage home. 
Thirty-six-year-old Michael de Wildt is trying to get from Watamu, north of Mombasa in Kenya, home to Melbourne.
“I feel like the Maze Runner because tomorrow I’m going to run a gauntlet: by taxi from Watamu to Mombasa, flight to Nairobi, flight to Dubai, flight to Melbourne, taxi to self-quarantine! Fingers crossed I remain Covid-19 free. If not and more importantly, I don’t infect others.”
Chris Selman, a 50-year-old engineer from Perth, is in Anchorage, Alaska, which is “about as far from home as it is possible to be”. He has struggled to change his flights, and has had no communication from airlines, spending more than four hours on hold before giving up.
He said the Australian government’s call for citizens to return was “sensible overall, but the suddenness is troubling and will place more strain on travel”.
“It would have been better to slowly ramp up the alert level over a few days. Makes us worried what they know and are not saying about coming border or airline closures and adds to the sense of panic and chaos.”
An Australian teacher in Laos, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was shocked to be told Australians have been advised to return home immediately.
“They say they aren’t going to close the [Australian] borders, but I am deeply suspicious and expect that might be the plan. I don’t think they are exaggerating the danger though, given the way the pandemic and the responses to the pandemic have unfolded around the world in the last few weeks. I am at the stage where I just want to go home and self-isolate for two weeks.”
There are also an estimated 300 Australian citizens and permanent residents, including young children separated from their parents, still in Wuhan, in Hubei province in central China, which was the original source of the virus and the first part of the world locked down. Many of these people, having missed spots on evacuation flights out of Wuhan, now say they feel safer in China, where the spread of the virus has been successfully mitigated."

Hospitality workers and businesses won’t be able to pay the rent within weeks without urgent action to get money into their pockets, unions and employers warn.
Employer body the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (Cosboa) and the United Workers Union both say hospitality businesses are in crisis and have already started closing and sacking people due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Piling pressure on the Morrison government to move more quickly in fighting the economic effects of the pandemic, both Cosboa and the UWU say laid-off workers need Centrelink benefits to start flowing immediately as rent and mortgage payments loom for households suddenly deprived of casual work and the income that comes along with it.
“With some workers already facing eviction, we could very easily see some of our members sleeping in their cars,” UWU spokeswoman Karma Lord said.
Sole traders also need immediate income support, Cosboa chief executive Peter Strong told Guardian Australia.
“We don’t want to start a panic, but it’s not called a crisis for no reason,” he said.
Economists warned that Australia’s economy was particularly vulnerable to an inevitable global recession due to its highly casualised workforce. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said his government was planning to make “survival” payments to keep virus-ravaged businesses afloat.
Australia’s sharemarket dived again on Wednesday, falling 6.43% and wiping out gains made on Tuesday.
Lord said the union was “hearing all across the hospitality industry that workers’ shifts are slashed, people are losing their jobs and some businesses are already closing”.
She said the new ban on gatherings of more than 100 people would make things even worse.
“We know that 79% of hospitality workers are casual and casuals are the first people on the chopping block and almost invariably, they have nothing to fall back on,” she said.
Unemployed Melbourne hospitality worker Tara Cairnduff, a long-time member of UWU division Hospo Voice, said laid-off workers were using a template she had created to write to their landlords and ask for a delay in paying the rent.
She said she was also working on a version for hospitality operators to send to commercial landlords.
“Heaps and heaps of people have needed to use it and used it and spread it around,” she said.
She said that on Facebook hospitality support pages “there are thousands and thousands of people closing their businesses”.
She said rent and mortgage payments needed to be dramatically cut or frozen during the crisis to prevent people being tipped on to the street, and Centrelink needed to dramatically improve its service levels.
Strong said the agency needed to be able to get money into people’s bank accounts “within a week or two” of them making an application.
Cosboa, like most employer bodies, also supports raising the Newstart rate by $95 a week.
Services Australia, which runs Centrelink, did not answer Guardian Australia’s questions about waiting and processing times.
“We are expecting an increase in members of the community seeking assistance from us during this time and we are prepared to respond accordingly,” spokesman Hank Jongen said.
Analysts at investment bank UBS say retail landlords will probably have to give rent holidays, which will put most pressure on debt-laden shopping centre operators Vicinity and Scentre.
Strong predicted the savage cuts to flights announced by Qantas and Virgin Australia over the past few days would also cost more jobs.
“You’re going to have people in the supply chain to the airlines, cleaners and caterers.
“They’re going to go under if they have no other business.”
As the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic emptied city streets, the Victorian premier said he would soon detail a “survival package” including cash handouts for businesses crushed by government bans on mass gatherings, a dive in restaurant bookings, closed city office towers and other effects of the crisis.
“We have many businesses who have zero income,” Andrews said.
“Offering them a tax cut doesn’t necessarily do it. If we are going to have some businesses close their doors, if we want to avoid them collapsing altogether and if we want to make sure they are there at the end of this virus, we need to be providing that sort of emergency capital, that sort of emergency cash.”
In a new report on Wednesday, ratings agency S&P said a recession across the Asia-Pacific was “guaranteed” and recovery would be slower than previously hoped.
Asia-Pacific chief economist Shaun Roache said the Australian economy was “particularly vulnerable” to mass sackings because many people already weren’t working as much as they would like.
“The underemployment problem is likely more acute in the accommodation and catering sectors, which account for over 7% of total employment,” he said.
“Of these jobs, over 60% are part time. While this give employers flexibility in reducing hours, the impact on workers can be brutally swift. In turn, this will hit consumer confidence and household income and spending.”
UBS predicts Australia will fall into recession this year and unemployment will soar from its current rate of 5.2% to as much as 8%."

","For some, workplaces are hotspots. For the over-65s, it’s shops and restaurants. We urgently need to change our behaviour
Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.
Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for diseases like Sars, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness – it is easy to recognise people who are infected.
In the case of Covid-19, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why airport screening at arrival is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, containment has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.
So how does an epidemic spread through a population – and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as R), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.
The larger the value of R, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to 1.4 new infections. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the early stages of an outbreak. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.
In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce R below 1. For diseases such as measles, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on R. For R of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for R of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get R below 1.
However, an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.
Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.
Another option to reduce the duration of infection is continued testing; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).
If we can’t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds with hot water and soap, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick – all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.
Cancelling large gatherings, working from home and school closures are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.
But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called BBC Pandemic, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.
What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 – who are particularly at risk from severe Covid-19 illness – make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.
Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number R, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.
We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it. Starting now, and for the duration of this epidemic, we all have a role to play and a responsibility to modify our behaviour in order to protect the ones who are most at risk.

Coronavirus: travellers race home amid worldwide border closures and flight warnings

Travellers across the world are scrambling to find flights home as governments urged their citizens to return and some nations announced the imminent closure of airports and borders.
As coronavirus cases near 200,000 globally, a growing number of countries have imposed lockdowns and barred entry to foreigners. As a result, passengers around the world are navigating rapidly changing travel advice, high fares and cancelled flights.
There have been 7,944 deaths worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
On Tuesday, the Australian government advised citizens to return home as soon as possible by commercial means, warning that overseas travel was becoming “more complex and difficult” as countries impose travel restrictions.
Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates have issued similar blanket advice.
In the UK, the foreign office has continued to issue a flurry of updated guidance for specific countries, warning against all but essential travel to a vast number of countries across Europe, as well as elsewhere. On Tuesday evening, it announced that it was withdrawing some staff from its embassy in Myanmar and told British citizen to leave the country if they were able to do so, adding: “This is due to potential pressures on medical facilities and the risk of air routes out of Myanmar being cancelled.”
The warnings from governments came as:
The World Health Organization called for “aggressive” action in south-east Asia, stating that some countries were heading towards community transmission.
Australia stepped up its response, announcing an indefinite new ban on indoor groups of 100 people or more, with exemptions for schools, public transport, universities, prisons, courts, supermarkets and worksites.
Kyrgyzstan in central Asia confirmed its first coronavirus cases, with three citizens testing positive after arriving from Saudi Arabia.
The US death toll passed 100 as coronavirus reached every state.
85,000 prisoners were temporarily released in Iran due to the coronavirus outbreak
Economists at ratings agency S&P said the much-feared worldwide recession had arrived and estimated global GDP would grow at 1%-1.5% in 2020, with the risk that it could sink even lower.
In the UK, where 1,960 cases have now been recorded, travellers have been forced to abandon studies, work trips and holidays. Some are racing to arrive home before their own countries announce a lockdown.
Governments in Asia, which are anticipating a rush of arrivals from virus hotspots in Europe, are heightening preventative measures to stop new cases from being imported.
A growing number of countries globally now require returnees to remain in isolation for 14 days. This also includes many countries in Europe, where leaders have announced plans to close their borders to almost all visitors, with exceptions made for European citizens and residents returning home. On Wednesday, Taiwan became the latest country to issue a similar notice, stating that non-residents will not be allowed entry from midnight tonight.
The rush to return home has been complicated by the growing number of entry restrictions announced globally, as well as airport closures. Canada has redirected international flights to a limited number of airports, while American returnees who have been in high-risk areas are also required to fly to one of 13 hubs. Elsewhere, airports closures have been announced in Sri Lanka, Egypt and Serbia.
Tessa McLean, from Herefordshire, is among tens of travellers, including children, stuck at Hurghada airport in Egypt, where all air traffic will be halted from tomorrow until 31 March.McLean, who is on holiday with her partner, was due to fly back on 24 March but fears she could now be left stranded. While she could stay until the airport is set to reopen in April, she fears that it may remain closed for longer and that travel could become even more complicated.
“At the moment nobody knows what’s going on,” she said. “We’re in better position than many because we have an apartment here but there are some people who have been told their hotels are closing because Egypt is going to try and knock this [outbreak] on the head.”The cost of fruit and vegetables in the market doubled last night as the surrounding roads were shut, she added. “We’re not getting any information from the embassy, the airline. There’s nobody here and we don’t know when somebody will come.”
Gaynor Monks, who is Australian, arrived in Sri Lanka two days ago for her mother-in-law’s 60th birthday and has also now been left stranded. Following the updated guidance she is trying to return home, but the airport is closed there and there is no official help, she told the Guardian on Tuesday.
“There are just no planes to take us. Because no planes are coming in, we are sort of stranded,” she said. She is already worried about her husband losing two weeks of work when they get home and he has to self-quarantine; he doesn’t get sick pay.
“Their message today was to contact your agent or contact the airline or insurance company, I can’t get hold of the agent, and the airline can’t help because we didn’t book direct, and the insurance company have let us down as they are not going to cover.”
The number of cases globally has reached 198,006, according to John Hopkins University, which is tracking the pandemic, while 7,948 people have died and 81,950 recovered."

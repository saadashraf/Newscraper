New rapid Covid-19 testing kit can return results in 15 minutes but not yet available in Australia

The federal health department says it sees “merit” in a newly developed rapid Covid-19 testing kit able to return results within 15 minutes, which experts say could help relieve significant pressure on pathology services.
Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has warned the country faces “extreme pressure” supplying enough testing kits as the rate of infection continues to skyrocket, warning last week that the number of pathology testing kits, reagents and swabs was “deteriorating rapidly” with some regions now completely out of supplies.
The government has so far refused to say how many testing kits remain in the country, although the health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Tuesday the supply was “sufficient for current requirements”.
As the virus spread in Wuhan, Chinese researchers developed a more rapid “point of care” screening test, which detects antibodies that emerge some time after Covid-19 symptoms appear. A study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology said the test could return results within 15 minutes, much faster than the current standard testing.
The test – known as the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit – is not currently in use in Australia, but the Guardian understands some companies are seeking to supply it onto the market.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the rapid test had “merit” and that there were “no compelling reasons not to use it based on the described science and methodology”.
But she said the company behind it, the Nantong Egens Biotechnology Company Ltd, had not yet approached the regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for assessment and approval.
Such a device would need to be approved through the TGA’s in-vitro diagnostics regulatory scheme before use, the department said.
The company has had the test validated by laboratories in Europe and China. But the spokeswoman said the same would need to occur in Australia.
“Tests also require validation by testing laboratories in the Australian context before use,” she said.
“The Department of Health, in collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Network, is monitoring the development of test kits and methodologies and their performance as they are used more widely around the world.”
In Australia, a company called Rapid COVID-19 is representing three manufacturers seeking to get TGA approval for the rapid tests. A company spokesman said: “Our TGA consultants have told us that unlike the US and Europe, securing approval will take too long and be very expensive.”
Experts approached by the Guardian said the testing had potential benefits and drawbacks. The testing does not require a laboratory, which could help alleviate pressure on Australia’s pathology services and the rest of the health system.
Andrew White, a virologist from the University of New South Wales, said if it were possible for rapid tests to be used by people at home it would help take the burden off an already strained health system.
“These tests will be useful for sure, they could keep infected people out of the health system and they do also provide peace of mind,” he said.
“There are certainly some advantages. If someone thinks they have the virus and can do the test at home in 15 minutes that’s someone who isn’t presenting at a hospital, GP or pathology lab.
“Even if you received a false positive, if you were able to take the precaution of having it backed up with [a traditional test] it would be good. If people received a negative result, they might be less inclined to visit the clinic which is going to free up hospital resources.”
But, he stressed, the tests were not always as reliable as those currently being used in Australia. Because rapid test kits look for antibodies associated with the virus rather than the virus itself, they could record false-negatives if used at the wrong time.
“The question is how significant those limitations are. It depends really on how many true cases you detect. Does it detect every positive, or does it miss 5%?” he said
“Because if you have to back up every test with a lab pathology test it might defeat the purpose a little bit.”
Bill Bowtell, an infectious diseases expert from the Kirby Institute, said while there was no shortage of medical supply companies looking to profit off the Covid-19 crisis, the TGA would need to consider the kits closely.
“In the end, anybody with anything to sell is in the market and their interest is to make the biggest claims,” he said.
“I think that’s the case with a lot of the things that we’ll see coming onto the market. There’s uncertainty because it didn’t come to market after stringent testing, it came to the market because there’s a feeling of ‘my god we need it’.
“In normal circumstances you wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole but this is what happens when there’s a crisis.”"

Australian airlines offer credit for cancelled flights as routes slashed amid coronavirus

Passengers can ask airlines for a credit for a cancelled flight but getting through to customer service will be a major challenge as Qantas and Jetstar cause chaos by grounding the majority of their international and domestic fleet.
The national carrier announced on Tuesday that 90% of international flights and 60% of domestic flights will be cancelled from the end of the month until the end of May, and Virgin is widely tipped to follow suit within days.
The airlines will honour the bookings with a flight credit voucher, which you can use within a fairly generous period of 12 months, but there is a deadline of 31 March for applying. The change fees – even on the cheapest restricted tickets – will be waived. However, the customer will have to cover the difference in the fare, if any.
Passengers who would like a full refund may be granted one if they insist, the aviation commentator Steve Creedy told Guardian Australia.
“At the moment most airlines are offering people the capacity to take a credit and I understand if you push they’ll give you a refund as well,” the south-east Asia bureau chief of Airline Ratings said.
“But the offer is for a credit for a flight at a later date. If you still absolutely want to fly in April or May given the drop in demand you may be able to fly but not necessarily on the flight you originally booked.”
The advice is don’t even try to get through on the phone; and if your flight is in the next day or so the airlines will contact you.
Some passengers have had success by contacting the company through its Facebook page.
“You can’t call,” Creedy said. “Pretty much all the call centres everywhere around the world are overloaded at the moment.
“It varies from airline to airline but unless you’re going to fly in the next 48 to 72 hours don’t call.”
If you booked your flights through a travel agent or a platform such as Booking.com or Webjet you need to contact them directly as Qantas won’t deal with your inquiry.
Qantas is advising on its website that due to high demand they’re experiencing long call wait times and are only dealing with urgent travel dates.
“We strongly encourage only those customers travelling within the next 48 hours to contact us if needed,” Qantas advises. “Consider contacting us at another time if you’re travelling outside this period.”
Creedy says the only way to contact any airline at the moment is online but even that can be frustrating.
“What I’ve found is that some airlines you can’t get online either,” he said.
Creedy said the grounding of so many flights was unprecedented.
“There’s been reductions in capacity before but not to the extent that we’ve seen here,” Creedy said. “This is bigger than anything I’ve seen in the quarter of a century I’ve been covering aviation in Australia.
“And it’s not just in Australia, of course, it’s global. American Airlines had huge cuts, Delta, Air Canada. They’re all trying to preserve cash. They don’t want to fly empty planes around and burn money.”
Qantas and Jetstar will make further and much larger cuts to domestic and international flying schedules. https://t.co/a2uX8SLCj3
Qantas and Jetstar said on Tuesday that significant falls in travel demand due to coronavirus and government restrictions meant further and much larger cuts to domestic and international flying schedules were necessary.
Creedy said passengers who chose to still fly during the restrictions would find the few planes in the air relatively empty.
“Delta said even with a 50% reduction in capacity in April and May they still only expected their planes to be 20 to 30% full,” Creedy said.
“With Qantas down to just 10% capacity I assume they’ll be pretty full, mainly with people coming home to Australia. With domestic it’s only a 60% cut so you should still be able to get a seat.
While flights will be refundable, travellers are faced with a headache for any land plans they made. Travel insurance taken out after late January will not be paid by most insurance companies.
Last week Qantas announced a 23% reduction in international flights and a 5% reduction in domestic flights, representing the grounding of 150 planes. Those original reductions between May and mid-September were still in place.
Qantas said flexibility would remain in place because things were changing rapidly.
“Customers who make a new domestic or international booking and later decide they no longer wish to travel, can cancel their flight and retain the value of the booking as a Qantas travel credit or Jetstar travel voucher. This applies to bookings made from 10 March 2020 until 31 March 2020 for travel before 31 May 2020.”"

Government urges Australians overseas to return home as borders close around the world

The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Australians to return home as soon as possible by commercial means because overseas travel is becoming “more complex and difficult” as countries impose travel restrictions and close their borders.
The new travel advice, issued on Tuesday night, triggered speculation that the Morrison government could be about to impose a lockdown in Australia. But officials told Guardian Australia that was not in contemplation.
Governments are poised to unveil new social distancing measures after a meeting between Scott Morrison and the premiers on Tuesday night. Leaders discussed additional restrictions on indoor gatherings and new measures for the aged care sector and remote Indigenous communities.
As well as the efforts to slow community transmissions of the illness, the Morrison government is also preparing a second multibillion-dollar “safety net” package. The Coalition is considering a boost to income support for welfare recipients and support for businesses at risk as a consequence of economic shock associated with the coronavirus.
While a second round of pump priming is being prepared, senior ministers on Tuesday warned the extra spending will not be enough to avoid widespread job losses stemming from the Covid-19 health crisis.
The health minister, Greg Hunt, on Tuesday also flagged a massive scaling up of public testing for the disease amid concern over test kit shortages, saying he will make a “major announcement” on the country’s testing regime on Wednesday.
According to the Department of Health, the global shortage of test kits is the reason behind the government’s decision to undertake targeted, rather than widespread testing.
The new Dfat travel advice asks Australians to reassess all overseas travel if it is non-essential, and it says: “If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means”.
Given more and more countries are closing their borders or introducing travel restrictions, Dfat advised people may not be able to return to Australia when they need to. “If you decide to return to Australia, do so as soon as possible. Commercial options may become less available,” Dfat said.
The department said the advice had been adjusted because there may be a higher risk of contracting the virus overseas and “you may come in contact with more people than usual, including during long-haul flights and in crowded airports”. It says health systems in some countries “may come under strain and may not be as well-equipped as Australia’s or have the capacity to support foreigners”.
“Overseas travel has become more complex and unpredictable. Many countries are introducing entry or movement restrictions. These are changing often and quickly. Your travel plans may be disrupted. You may be placed in quarantine or denied entry to some countries, and you may need to self-quarantine on return to Australia”.
“Think about what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities”.
As of Tuesday, there are 438 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia, with a third federal politician – the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg – among the latest to test positive to the disease.
Three senators who attended a committee hearing with Bragg last week – Jenny McAllister, Tony Sheldon and Rex Patrick – are now in self-isolation.
The rapidly escalating crisis has prompted the Coalition to hastily develop another wave of economic stimulus, which is expected to be more far-reaching than the $17.6bn package announced last week.
Federal cabinet discussed options in a meeting on Tuesday, with the measures also discussed by the cabinet’s expenditure review committee, however it is understood no final decisions have been made.
The government is looking at ways to ramp up support through existing programs and mechanisms, but the package is unlikely to be announced until after the Reserve Bank of Australia intervenes again on Thursday either through another emergency rate cut or a significant purchase of government bonds.
It is expected the government will put the new measures to a scaled-down parliament next week to be voted on before the Easter break and the May budget.
It is possible the government will also a deliver a separate assistance package for airlines in advance of unveiling the second round of stimulus either at the weekend or early next week. Qantas has signalled it will close 90% of international flights and 60% of domestic flights from the end of the month.
The government and the opposition have agreed that only 90 of the country’s 151 MPs will come to Canberra for the next parliamentary session, along with 54 of the country’s 76 senators.
The package is expected to target both heavily affected industries as well as vulnerable low-income earners.
However, even with the extra billions of dollars in government support, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, warned that the “grim reality” was that jobs would be lost as the country faced an “unprecedented” economic shutdown.
“We are very conscious that as we are looking at things today, that many businesses will close and many Australians will lose their jobs,” Cormann said on Tuesday.
“We will ensure that they have got the appropriate levels of support through this transition to the other side when there will be a strong bounce back and a strong recovery.”
The finance minister also revealed that the government was looking at specific measures to help vulnerable low-income earners, who he conceded would be hard hit by a downturn.
“We are very seriously considering what appropriate supports we can provide, in particular to the most vulnerable across our community and specifically those that are most severely impacted,” Cormann said.
“This is going to be a tough period. There will be a strong recovery on the other side, but it is going to be a tough period. We are all in this together. We are going to come up with the best possible way to get ourselves through this period.”
Amid calls for the government to do more to protect casual workers, the minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said the existing social safety net was the best delivery mechanism “for those who will need help in the challenging times ahead”.
“But however many people may require help in the challenging times ahead, because they find they are not able to work or because they have experienced unemployment due to changed economic conditions, the best assistance mechanism is the welfare system because of its proven ability to deliver income support to affected workers,” Porter told Guardian Australia.
“This is the most effective way to ensure income support reaches those in need as simply and quickly as possible, with regular waiting periods waived.”
Porter said that while the government was not considering “wholesale structural change” to the industrial relations system, those most affected needed “income support until things improve”.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, called on the government to offer more support for anyone in the workforce who has to self-isolate without access to an income – including both employees and small business people.
“Many businesses are paying to cover periods in isolation, even where there is no legal obligation to do so,” Pearson said.
“But small, family-owned businesses struggling to survive, let alone retain the staff they have, do not have the resources to support additional payments for casuals.”"

What effect will winter have on coronavirus in Australia?

In many parts of the world, wintertime tends to be when people get sick from viruses that cause colds and influenza.
The illness Covid-19 broke out in China’s winter and spread in Iran, Italy and the rest of Europe as those countries endured their coldest months.
As Australia heads into winter, what could this mean for the spread of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes the Covid-19 illness?
Experts have told Guardian Australia that cooler temperatures can affect the behaviour and spread of a virus in three interconnected ways.
Firstly, temperatures can affect the virus directly.
Some viruses may have a temperature range where they can survive for longer and this is partly dependent on their “envelope” – the outer layer that’s made of lipids (which is why washing hands with soap is effective, because it disrupts the lipids).
Secondly, when temperatures drop, this changes the behaviour of the human population. People tend to spend more time indoors and in closer contact, making it easier for the virus to spread.
Thirdly, we already know that like in other parts of the world, winter in Australia is when other viruses circulate and this can affect the immunity of populations.
Associate Prof Tom Kotsimbos of Monash University, who is also a respiratory physician at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, says seasonality can cause an increase in the spread of viruses.
“That is well established, but whether we understand that deeply is another thing. It does have an influence, but we don’t understand it specifically. This is a new virus, and that does not mean it will be like the others.
“We know it’s about the biology of the virus, the general and specific immunity of us and the environmental and behavioural conditions,” he says.
But there is much less certainty, he says, about how important each factor is when it comes if a person gets sick.
“It’s interesting that [Covid-19] has spread all over the world quite quickly – both north and south,” he said, adding that this suggested either the new virus was not dependent on temperature or that this dependency was not as important as the lack of immunity in the population that was helping it to spread.
Some studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed have tried to find out if there is a clear link between temperature and the rate of infection of the coronavirus, but have been inconclusive or contradictory.
Dr Meru Sheel of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at Australian National University, says: “There is no clear evidence to suggest a relationship between outdoor temperatures and spread of coronaviruses.
“We don’t know enough about Sars-CoV-2 yet to know how change in weather will affect outbreak and the disease epidemiology.
“In some tropical countries such as Pacific Island countries, despite the warm weather, there is some seasonal influenza activity and it is related to increase in travellers from countries such as Australia and New Zealand and to a much lesser extent related to change in weather.”
Sheel said studies are under way investigating the duration of the survival of Sars-CoV-2 under different conditions and on different surfaces.
“Evidence from these studies is likely to improve our understanding of the disease transmission pathways and improve our response strategy.
“However until we know more, we need to ensure that all surfaces are decontaminated using disinfectants such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, bleach etc – based on local infection, prevention and control guidelines.”
Sheel pointed to a review of research into other known human coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers, that found the viruses survived for varying lengths of time.
The study found they could be infectious on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, metal, wood and paper for up to nine days, but disinfectant cleaning was effective.
Sheel says rather than the temperature itself, the change in the way Covid-19 spreads “is likely influenced by frequency at which people interact during cooler versus warmer weather”.
Dr Chris Burrell, emeritus professor of virology of the University of Adelaide, said there were other known coronaviruses that had been around for half a century and these were also prevalent in winter.
“But that’s because of people congregating together,” he said.
He said one example of this effect was with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that causes a common respiratory disease in young children that tends to arrive in winter.
Burrell says: “If you think of children in preschool, in the summer they’re out in the sun and don’t have a lot of personal contact with each other. In winter, they’re inside and breathing the same air.
“I think that any effect of temperature on coronavirus won’t be nearly as important as the effect of limiting its spread by isolating people.”
Ten years ago Tom Kotsimbos led a taskforce of respiratory specialists that looked at what impact a potential early winter arrival of swine flu could have on Australia’s population.
He said the same questions that were being asked then – about the influence of temperature and the overlap with Australia’s flu season – are being asked again now.
“Clearly this is a different virus – but we have been here before ... but we don’t know how Covid-19 will behave.
“On an individual level, if you get a virus when your defences are already down from a recent viral infection, then that could be increasingly challenging with the progression of the disease.
“Previous studies have suggested that if you have recently recovered from a viral infection then your innate immune systems may actually be bolstered and that might help with subsequent attacks.”
He said adding the impacts of Covid-19 on top of flu season “will put an incredible stress on the healthcare system”.
Dr Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said: “My concern is that [in winter] people tend to be in closer contact and it coincides with our flu season.
“My main concern is that when you think of the healthcare system, that does get pushed in a bad flu season. If we combine a moderate flu season with a moderate coronavirus season, that could be problematic.”
Sheel said: “As Australia moves into cooler weather, we are likely to see an increase in respiratory diseases such as common colds, influenza and RSV infections.
“To minimise the pressure on the health system it will be important for the community to adopt public health prevention measures, get vaccinated and staying at home when unwell – practising social distancing.
“This will also help improve our ability to test for Covid-19 and in return protect our vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions and minimise their risk of exposure to infection with Covid-19. All these factors will contribute towards better control of the outbreak.”"
9,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/the-big-question-over-coronavirus-can-a-person-get-it-twice,None,One of the most concerning issues since the emergence of the Covid-19 virus has been whether those who have had it can get it a second time – and what that means for immunity.,"Definitive answer not yet known, but experts say reinfection seems unlikely
On Monday, both Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, Boris Johnson’s chief medical adviser, sought to reassure the public. Those who have had the virus once will develop some immunity, they said – and it is rare to get an infectious disease again.
The questions first arose last month, after Japanese authorities said a woman who had had the virus, and been declared virus-free, had tested positive again. Scientists were left confused by the news and and also uneasy.
Prof Mark Harris, an expert in virology at Leeds University, said reinfection in that case was “unlikely”, but added that “there is some evidence in the scientific literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses (mainly in bats)”.
When Vallance was asked on Monday if the Japanese case meant herd immunity was no longer achievable, he replied that some people do catch infectious diseases a second time, but that it is a rare occurrence. There was no evidence to suggest that it would occur with the coronavirus, he added.
Prof Whitty explained that with diseases, even if there is no long-term immunity, there is normally some short-term immunity.
Prof Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, said: “The answer is that we simply don’t know [about reinfection] yet because we don’t have an antibody test for the infection, although we will have soon.
“However, it is very likely, based on other viral infections, that yes, once a person has had the infection they will generally be immune and won’t get it again. There will always be the odd exception, but that is certainly a reasonable expectation.” "

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.
No. In the UK, the medical advice is now that the household of anyone who develops a new persistent cough or high temperature should all stay at home for 14 days, keeping away from other people. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.
You should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.
China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. There is now extensive human to human transmission across the world.
As of 15 March, more than 182,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have been over 7,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 79,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.
We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.
Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected."

Paul Karp","Medical officers have not recommended mass closures amid dissenting views on whether – and when – it will be necessary


Mon 16 Mar 2020 09.24 GMT

Australia has introduced a ban on non-essential mass gatherings of 500 people or more to control the spread of Covid-19, but so far has not opted for mass closure of schools.
Several schools in New South Wales and Victoria with confirmed cases of coronavirus have temporarily shut, but chief medical officers have not advised wide-scale closure.
So why hasn’t closure been recommended and are there dissenting views about whether – and when – it will be necessary?
On Sunday, Scott Morrison said:
[On] the issue of wide-scale closure of schools, it might be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could actually be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these curves operate.
That happens for two reasons. When you take children out of schools and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk. And that’s the understanding we have …
The other issue is the disruption impact that can have and put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses and doctors and others who are essential in the community because they would have to remain home and look after their children.
And so while it may seem counterintuitive, there is very good reason why you would not be moving to broadscale closures of schools that could actually make the situation worse, not better. And so the states and territories are not moving in that direction.
Yes. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee – composed of federal, state and territory – has advised at this stage that essential functions, including schools, universities, workplaces and public transport do not need to stop functioning.
In a statement, the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has said that he “fully endorses” the committee’s advice “that pre-emptive school closures are not likely to be proportionate or effective as a public health intervention to prevent community transmission of Covid-19 at this time”.
He said:
There is currently limited information on the contribution of children to transmission of Covid-19. The WHO-China joint mission noted the primary role of household transmission and observed that children tended to be infected from adults.
Previous work suggests that the potential reduction in community transmission from pre-emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements that are in place for children who are not at school.
There is a particular risk associated with the fact that children may require care from vulnerable grandparents or may continue to associate (and transmit infection) outside of school settings.
Broadly the health advice on school closures from previous respiratory epidemics shows the health costs are often underestimated and the benefits overestimated.
This may be even more so in relation to Covid-19 as unlike influenza the impact on otherwise healthy children has been minimal to date.
Some have suggested that preventing transmission in all settings, including schools, should be the priority.
The general practitioner and former AMA president, Kerryn Phelps, has said “within a very short time frame we’re going to have to look at the closure of schools and closure of universities for a couple of weeks in order to help with limitation of transmission”.
Anthony Albanese has noted that some private and independent schools have opted to close but has stopped short of calling for mass school closures.
“What I don’t want is the government to be too far behind here,” he told Sky News.
“I can’t see how [school closures] won’t happen at some stage. What we need, though, is for those decisions to be essentially recommended by the medical officers – if they say that is where it’s going to go, we need transparency.”
Prof Jonathan Carapetis, a paediatrician and a leading expert on infectious diseases, told Guardian Australia the medical community’s view is “not that straightforward” but everyone agrees a “balanced discussion” rather than knee-jerk reaction is required.
The executive director of Telethon Kids Institute said the argument for school closures is to prevent transmission from child to child and back to their family.
“But the evidence that closing schools will have a significant impact on transmission of the pandemic is not that strong,” he said.
“Children don’t seem to get severely unwell, they either get a mild version or show no signs of illness, so the early data is that they are not significantly involved in transmission.”
School closure “is not the panacea some may think”, Carapetis said, citing the fact it could take 10-20% of people out of the workforce and put parents and grandparents at risk of a more severe health outcome.
Carapetis suggested that children in school are “easier to control” because they can be taught hand hygiene and measures like banning assemblies and school carnivals can reduce risks.
Morrison has noted that the prospect of developing herd immunity has been raised in the UK.
Carapetis explained that one way to prevent transmission is to “increase the proportion of the population with some immunity to the disease”.
“Given we know kids don’t get so sick [from Covid-19] it’s possible that a higher proportion could become immune and can’t transmit it, which is known as herd immunity.”
But Carapetis warned although there is a “good theoretical basis” for that view, there is so far no data to back it and it is only an assumption that children will gain immunity once infected. As such, it should “not be a significant factor” in potential school closures.
On Sunday, Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, said: “And that important issue of herd immunity that we talk about a lot in vaccination is exactly the challenge that we have at the moment. There is no herd immunity. Everyone is susceptible to this virus in Australia.”
Phelps said there was “no point talking about herd immunity … unless you’re talking about immunisation, and we don’t have a vaccine for coronavirus”.
“If you had a vaccine, you would get as many people vaccinated as possible,” she told Sky News.
“You don’t increase herd immunity by making as many people as possible sick so that they then transmit the virus to someone who can’t cope with it.”
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has suggested school closures are “inevitable”.
The Australian Medical Association’s Western Australian president, Andrew Miller, has predicted widespread school closures will happen in the near future.
“The schools, we need a bit of preparation time, but it will be coming,” he reportedly told the ABC. “Sometime in the next few weeks we would expect the government would be looking closely at that.
“I suspect what will happen is that schools won’t go back after the holidays.”
Sutton noted that for pre-emptive school closures to be effective they would need to be “prolonged” and it was unclear when they would reopen.
Sutton has suggested that “school closures may still be considered late in the outbreak in anticipation of a peak in infection rates for a shorter period of time”."

Melissa Davey","Doctors send letter to health minister saying schools and public places should be closed, but experts warn public panic could force politicians to make bad decisions


Tue 17 Mar 2020 04.29 GMT

Almost 2,500 doctors have urged the health minister, Greg Hunt, to take immediate action on containment measures around the country to curb coronavirus.
Led by Dr Hemant Garg, the letter states doctors are “dismayed at the disconnect between the actions being taken within the medical community and the recommendation for actions being passed on to the general population”.
“We should immediately recommend a three to four week closure of schools, cultural and religious places including places of worship, gyms and leisure centres, pubs, bars, theatres, cinemas and concert halls,” the letter states. “This would allow a steady declaration of cases of coronavirus to present to hospitals and fever clinics as their symptomatic phase develops.”
On social media many doctors and members of the public are also calling for immediate school closures and shutdowns. A separate letter, led by an intensive care specialist in Sydney and directed to the prime minister, calls for an immediate lockdown of Australia.
“Many of us are in contact with colleagues in Italy, Spain and France and they are begging us to learn from their mistakes,” the letter states.
“With access to intensive care the death rate from COVID19 is likely less than 1%, but in an overwhelmed system without access to intensive care the death rate approaches 4%.”
On Tuesday Hunt said while school closures had not been ruled out, “mass school closures would impact significantly on critical emergency service workers, on health workers, as well as exposing young people potentially to being with grandparents on a much more broader basis”.
Prof Julie Leask, from the University of Sydney’s faculty of health and medicine, said pressure should not dissuade the federal government from following advice from the key decision-making committee for health emergencies, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.
She said because of public panic and fear she is “concerned the pressure will be so high on politicians to adopt a strategy that doesn’t have a good evidence base, and that they may overrule the measures the Committee are advising”.
The current national advice is to get tested if you:
The national coronavirus health information hotline is 1800 020 080.The federal health department has a coronavirus health alert website. 
The state health department websites and contact numbers are:
“There’s a real risk of that,” she said. “[Former labor party leader] Bill Shorten deciding to remove his children from schools is a personal decision but by making it public it sends a signal to the wider community that it’s something that should be done, when the advice right now is not to do that. We are in a precarious time. But it’s not like the government is sitting on its hands.”
However, Leask said the views of the doctors should be listened to by the federal government.
“They are facing a very large demand on health care services and it’s clearly filling them with dread, the idea of an Italy-type situation where they have to make decisions about who gets the ventilator and who doesn’t. What strategies are taken now to flatten the curve are essential,” she said.
“This is a very tense time and people are angry and scared. But the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee recommendations are being informed by careful modelling of infection spread balanced against unintended consequences of something like closing schools.
“That expertise needs to be respected in the same way you might respect your neurology colleague in terms of how to treat someone with delirium.”
Leask said to quell public panic the federal government needed to do “a much better job” at communicating the reasons behind their decisions.
A communique issued by the Australian Medical Association federal council on Tuesday agreed, stating “consistent, succinct and contemporaneous communication across all media from a single trusted source must be provided” to the public.
“Public education on effective and sensitive public distancing measures should focus on individual as well as institutional responsibilities,” the AMA said. “Planning should be undertaken for potential advanced education centre closures, workplace restrictions, and the possibility of school closures.”
Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, issued a statement explaining why closing schools doesn’t necessarily help flatten the curve. He said research shows the potential reduction in community transmission from pre-emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements for children not at school.
The infectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist Prof Lyn Gilbert said there was still limited community transmission of the virus in Australia. She said while stopping large public gatherings, testing and tracing measures and hygiene messaging had assisted with this, modelling data shows blanket closure of schools has little effect on transmission.
“People are getting quite excited about the idea of shutting everything down suddenly,” she said. “You can’t easily keep that going for any length of time unless you do it with sensible justification and gradually. People will tolerate it for a couple of weeks but not a long time without justification. People must be considered about how it’s done and use evidence and do it gradually, and that’s happening at the moment. There will be progressive announcements.”
It was also important that Australia had acted much more swiftly than Italy, Gilbert said.
“We just have to be patient and not give in to the panicked demands of people saying shut it all down,” she said. “I’ve seen people saying shut everything down for 18 months until we have a vaccine, but there is no guarantee we will have one.”"

Trump says 'keep politics out' of coronavirus then picks fight with Democrats

Donald Trump has picked fights with two Democratic state governors while calling for them to “keep politics out” of the battle against what he called “the Chinese virus”.
The US president wielded his favourite cudgel, Twitter, to go after Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. This was despite Trump urging national unity in recent days and even softening his tone towards the media.
Reverting to type, he tweeted on Tuesday: “Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.”
But Trump then added: “Andrew, keep politics out of it … ”
It was the continuation of an online spat between the Republican president and Democratic governor that began on Monday. New York is the state where Trump was born and built his fortune and is now among the worst affected by the virus.
But at a press conference in Albany, New York, Cuomo struck a conciliatory tone, saying he had spoken to Trump this morning and found him “ready, willing and able to help”.
Cuomo told reporters: “I said to the president, who is a New Yorker, who I’ve known for many, many years, ‘I put my hand out in partnership. I want to work together 100%. I want your help. I need your help.’
“I think the president was 100% sincere in saying he wanted to work together in partnership, in a spirt of cooperation. The actions he has taken evidence that. His team are on it.”
The governor added: “We’re not Democrats, we’re not Republicans, we are Americans at the end of the day. That’s who we are. That’s who we are when we’re at our best.”
There is no time for “hypersensitivity” about politics, Cuomo added. “The president is doing the right thing in offering to step up for New York and I appreciate it, and New York will do the right thing in return.”
But Trump had also attacked Whitmer, the Michigan governor seen as a potential running mate for Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who has said he will choose a woman as his vice-presidential nominee.
“Failing Michigan governor must work harder and be much more proactive,” the president wrote, not mentioning Whitmer by name. “We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!”
Whitmer shot back via Twitter: “Now that I’ve got your attention, Mr President – attack tweets won’t solve this crisis. But swift and clear guidance, tests, personal protective equipment, and resources would.”
She went on to list all the measures taken so far by the state, which remains a key battleground in the November presidential election.
There has been previous criticism of Trump and Republicans for using xenophobic dog whistles such as “foreign virus” and “Wuhan virus”. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, used the term “Chinese Coronavirus” in a tweet on 9 March.
In a Twitter thread more than a month ago, World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the 2019 novel strain of the coronavirus had an official name, Covid-19, and warned: “Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.”
On Tuesday Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent of CBS News, tweeted: “This morning a White House official referred to #Coronavirus as the ‘Kung-Flu’ to my face. Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back.”
Trump has claimed credit for banning travel from China early in the crisis but faced condemnation for downplaying the threat and not moving faster to introduce widespread testing. However, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, suggests the president should not be blamed.
Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, which introduced new guidelines for the public on Monday, told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that “a technical glitch” slowed down the distribution of coronavirus tests.
He added: “The regulatory constraints, which under certain circumstances are helpful and protective of the American people were not suited to the emergence of this particular outbreak. So there was a confluence of a bunch of things.”
Hewitt asked: “Was the glitch or anything about the production of the test President Trump’s fault? Or actually, let me put it more broadly, would every president have run into the same problem?”
Fauci replied: “Oh, absolutely. This has nothing to do with anybody’s fault, certainly not the president’s fault.”"

After pictures of Florida beaches packed with spring breakers appeared on social media, Florida Governor Rick DeSantis has issued an executive order in an effort to quell critics. 
However, his new order is muddy at best. 
BUSY BEACH! This is what @MyClearwater Beach looks like right now as spring break crowds flock to the sand. #Clearwater leaders haven’t decided if they should add a curfew or close beaches but they may vote on measures related to the #coronavirus this Thursday. @abcactionnews pic.twitter.com/jGoxQdYJg5
The order closes nightclubs and bars for 30 days, but encourages restaurants to stay open while only seating people at half-capacity. Restaurants are also required to stagger seating. The order also asks people not to go to public beaches in groups greater than 10, “per CDC guidance”. 
However, the CDC has strongly encouraged people to go much further than DeSantis’s order. The CDC has directed people “avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts,” to “avoid travel, shopping trips, and social visits”.These practices are part of “social distancing”. Here’s an expert guide on how to practice social distancing and slow the spread of the virus.

The Guardian’s tech reporter Kari Paul reports: 
Shared scooter company Lime is suspending services in US markets including California and Washington state, as well as in Italy, France, Spain, due to coronavirus concerns, it said in a statement on Monday evening. 
The company, which is owned by Uber, said it is pausing services to “help people stay put, and stay safe” as a number of states and cities enact shelter in place orders. Uber and other rideshare services are not affected by the shelter in place order in California as they are considered essential businesses, but Lime is still shutting down services.
“In the Bay Area we are temporarily pausing operations and taking scooters offline to comply with government orders, and we ask the Lime community to do their part in protecting themselves and each other”, a spokesman said. “We are committed to quickly reactivating once the coronavirus virus is under control”.
Lyft is still running its scooters, it said in a Monday email, and regularly sanitizing them. Bay Area residents could still be seen riding them Monday, some wearing masks. Bird, another commonly used shared scooter startup in the Bay Area, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the status of its program.

In a meeting with tourism industry executives, Donald Trump previewed the relief plan being considered in Congress, according to the White House press pool.
“Thank you very much we have tourism industry executives...the true leaders of our tourism and hospitality industries,” Trump said. “We are going to come out stronger than ever before.”
The president said he asked Small Business Administration lending to go up To $50 billion, “and actually more”.

Following lunch with treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, Republican senators seem open to growing the debt in order to provide stimulus relief. 
“The bottom line is, as a matter of course and in the everyday affairs of this country, I believe very much that we should not be growing the debt,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told reporters on Capitol Hill. But he added: “These are not normal times. The circumstances in which we live in now have no precedent.”
He seemed positive that lawmakers woud pass some sort of stimulus package. “I think really now it’s a question of drafting it and crafting it in a way that can pass and that will work soon enough,” he said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is discussing a stimulus plan that would include sending out $250bn worth of checks to Americans, amounting to two weeks of pay, by the end of April, according to multiple reports. 
INSIDE THE SENATE R-MNUCHIN LUNCHMNUCHIN said he wants to send out $250 billion worth of checks — means tested. First wave would go out at the end of April. If TRUMP has not ended the natl emergency, another wave goes out four weeks later. Mnuchin notes he’s working with IRS
Mnuchin met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors to discuss a stimulus package which would also include aid for the airline industry, small-business support and a payroll tax holiday. The totals cost of the stimulus package is estimated to be between $800bn and $1 trillion, per reports.

Medical and student debt owed to New York state will be temporarily suspended, according to the state’s attorney general. “In this time of crisis, I won’t add undue stress or saddle NYers with unnecessary financial burden, this is the time to support residents,” said attorney general Letitia James, in a tweet. 
Effective immediately, I'm temporarily halting the collection of state medical & student debt owed to NYS that was referred to my office. In this time of crisis, I won't add undue stress or saddle NYers with unnecessary financial burden, this is the time to support residents.
James’ measure won’t affect debt owed to the federal government but will bring some temporary relief to those who owe the state government.

The virus that causes COVID-19 can survive for hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces, according to new research from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and universities.
The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 
NIH scientists advise that people clean and disinfect frequently touched objects using regular household cleaning sprays.

Duncan Hunter, the disgraced California congressman who pleaded guilty to stealing his campaign funds and spending the money on vacations, school tuition for his children and shopping sprees, has been sentenced to 11 months in prison. 
His attornies had asked for home confinement, citing his military and congressional service. Hunter resigned from Congress in January after serving nearly six terms representing one of California’s last solidly red districts. 
A district court judge also sentenced Hunter to three years of supervised release.

The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports:
Rebecca Gross, 16, showed up to work as a student election judge at 5 a.m. this morning, but said election officials had yet to deliver any of the equipment needed to run an election by midday to her precinct.“No people at our precinct are able to vote,” she said in an interview. She said election workers at her precinct in Chicago’s Boystown neighborhood had been trying to contact local election officials, but were sent to a full voice mailbox.
Gross said she and other election workers began redirecting people to a nearby precinct where they could vote. So far, she estimated they had turned away about 75 people. “It sucks, honestly,” she said of redirecting people. “A lot of people have ended up saying ‘I actually can’t do that, I have work.’”
Amid fears about the coronavirus, Gross said she brought her own wipes and gloves from home to share with other workers. The only materials election officials provided to the poll workers at her precinct were four bottles of hand sanitizer and one roll of Clorox wipes.

 Gross said she thinks Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, should have moved to postpone the primary election, following the lead of a handful of other states that have chosen to do so.

Maanvi Singh, here. I’ll be bringing you more updates on the administration’s evolving response to the coronavirus pandemic. In the meantime, voting is still underway in Illinois. Officials say they’ve taken precautions to protect poll workers shortages and confusion over polling locations.
It seems some voters are also donating sanitizing products in order to help keep poll workers safe.

The president and Republican leaders have been strongly criticized for referring to coronavirus as the Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, reflecting where the pandemic began.
The Guardian’s David Smith, at the White House coronavirus task force briefing now still going on in Washington, just asked Donald Trump about his use once gain, just this morning on Twitter, of the title “Chinese virus”.
Trump defended it. “China was putting out information that our military gave it to them. We have to call it where it came from, it came from China,” he said.
But would that perpetuate stigma, Smith asked in his follow-up, against China and the Chinese?
Trump said: “Saying that our military gave it to them, that creates a stigma,” he said. The race to the bottom continues.
A prominent Chinese official last week promulgated the inaccurate notion that coronavirus may have been brought to the city of Wuhan (where the outbreak began) by the US army.
Here’s the relevant tweet from Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao.
2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3
Ah, Trump now returning to familiar territory, slamming the mainstream media for not praising his and his administration’s approach to tackling coronavirus.


4.47pm GMT
16:47


The man who first said words to the effect that the coronavirus was a Democratic party hoax and a media fantasy just emphasized once again, in this new week for Donald Trump, how seriously everyone needs to take the virus. And how seriously he is taking it.
“We are looking at saving the maximum number of lives. Everything else will come back, lives do not come back,” the president just said at the White House briefing now ongoing.
“This is a pandemic,” he stated. Then he stepped outside the truth.
“I have always viewed it as very serious,” he said.
As the Guardian’s David Smith wrote in that article:
Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was “very much under control” and infections were “going very substantially down, not up”. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be “close to zero”.
He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as “their new hoax”, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). 
But the usual playbook of deny and distract proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.

Silver linings: how to stay positive during the coronavirus crisis

These stories are designed to offer practical advice, provide some entertainment, foster a sense of social cohesion, and remind people of the good in the world during these strange and isolating times.
With all the tragic things that are happening in the world as a result of the coronavirus, now might seem like an unusual time to talk about being positive. Yet staying positive is a core ingredient in the recipe of successful coping in a crisis.
Now, more than ever, is the time for us to be proactive about creating small moments of happiness in our days, given the findings in psychology research that positive emotions help us to undo the negative effects of stress.
I’ll come to the research in a minute, but first there are a few really practical things you can do to foster positive emotions.
Savour the small moments: Even during lockdown you still have many small moments to savour. The smell of coffee, the feel of the warm shower on your back and so on. When you stop to take in these moments, rather then let them rush by on automatic pilot, you are giving your brain a chance to process the pleasure, which boosts your serotonin – the feel good neurotransmitter that helps elevate your mood and make you feel calm.
Strengthen your connections: for those of us in family lockdown, now is the opportunity to spend quality time with our loved ones. Take the time to hug your kids or partner, look them in the eyes, have long conversations with them – all of these gestures promote closeness and also boost your oxytocin, which is a hormone that bonds people and also has a calming effect on your body. When your oxytocin levels spike they tell your body to switch off cortisol, the stress hormone.
Look for the good in others: These types of crises can bring out both the worst and the best in human nature. This week there were two Youtube clips that went viral in Australia about toilet paper. One was of three grown women fighting in Woolworths over a packet of toilet paper. The other was two young children dragging a large cart of toilet paper behind them and stopping at the homes of elderly people in their neighbourhood to give them a roll. I like to think that the best in human nature is rising to the coronavirus challenge. Philanthropists are donating money to scientists to find a cure. Doctors and medical staff are working overtime to help sick patients. Neighbourhoods are putting together care packages for people who are sleeping rough. People are posting positive messages on social media. Friends from across the globe reaching out to each other. When we tune into these positive and pro-social aspects of the crisis, we are united in hope.
By tuning into these three silver linings, you can potentially change your brain chemistry and build up your energy stores to help you cope with the other aspects of your day that have been made more difficult.
Taking charge of our mental health and capturing the small moments will help as we go further into the unknown, too. If we can foster positive emotions, the flow-on effects are well researched, and well documented. In fact, positive emotions are a key resource for us during the coronavirus crisis because they can do a number of things:
Increase your resilience: Research has shown that when we experience positive emotions on the back of a stressful event, we bounce back more quickly and have a faster “cardiovascular recovery” time – our heart rate lowers and our blood pressure stabilises more quickly when we are able to be positive.
Increase your immunity: a study where people were deliberately infected with the influenza virus and rhinovirus found that those people who had more positive emotions were more likely to fight off the symptoms. People low on positive emotions were 2.9 times more likely to contract a respiratory illness in this study.
Make you think more clearly: the way we feel influences the way we think. Positive emotions boost our problem solving abilities as well as our judgment, decision-making, cognitive flexibility and creativity. Staying positive will help you and your kids to be better at solving all the little problems that are being thrown our way right now, such as figuring out new technology platforms for working (and schooling) from home.
Every dark cloud has a silver lining and this is your chance to thicken that lining and take charge of your mental health so that you come out of this experience stronger.

The BBC World Service’s 13 Minutes to the Moon is guaranteed to take you to a different time and place from where we’re at right now. And it’s also a reminder of what a determined community inspired by a great leader can do. There were 13 minutes from when the Apollo 11 lunar lander detached from the mother ship to when it landed on the moon’s surface. The podcast takes you through, in detail, those 13 minutes, with original audio, new interviews and archived interviews from many of those who were there. There’s original music, too, from the great Hans Zimmer – and even a bonus episode all about the music.
Start from the beginning! The second series that looks at the doomed Apollo 13 mission is just out. – Graham Readfearn, environment reporter
Was it an urban myth or was it real? Generations of journalists heard the story from rickshaw drivers, fixers, tea-sellers. The story was that in the forest in the city limits of Delhi, cut off from the world, lived a prince, a princess and a queen. They were said to be the last of a distinguished Shia Muslim royal line. Before moving to the crumbling forest palace, they had taken up residence in the first-class waiting room of the Delhi railway station. While in exile at the station, they demanded that their lineage be recognised.
Ellen Barry, a New York Times journalist, unpicks this wild and at times unsettling story with great care and sensitivity in the three-part series for the Daily, The Jungle Prince of Delhi. It sounds like folklore but by episode three it becomes deeply political. In the end it’s a story of family, homeland, dislocation, trauma and the damage done by Partition. And at its conclusion, it had me weeping. – Brigid Delaney, columnist
This is the story of coworking juggernaut WeWork and its cult-like founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, who took the company from living room start-up to blockbuster valued at $47bn – before hubris sent it into a massive nosedive. This six-part series is a truly fascinating insight into the charlatans and grifters of the business world, from “disruptor” disciples to “unicorn” hunters, and the way it all thrives on hot air. As with all good tales of downfall, the best place to start is the beginning. – Stephanie Convery, deputy culture editor
Its host Molly Fischer has now left the show, but while she was at the helm, The Cut on Tuesdays provided 48 bingeable episodes of well-reported, feminist, funny discussion from topics ranging from the very heavy (what it’s like to be a woman in a migrant caravan) to the light and effervescent (what it means to be horny in 2019). This show listens like a conversation between your smartest girlfriends, who just so happen to be very good journalists. It sounded like everything female-focused media should be, but often isn’t. Start with the episode about pubic hair for a chat that’s often had in private, made public, or Welcome to my Bad Dinner Party, for a cooking challenge with a difference, made even tastier by the wisdom of Samin Nosrat. – Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor
Molly is diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, leaves her unhappy marriage of 15 years and embarks on a series of sexual adventures – then sits down in a studio and tells her best friend Nikki all about it.
Start from episode one, but episode two is when you’ll be clutching your sides laughing and/or dying of embarrassment. It’s a great reflection on what it means to feel alive, even when death is just around the corner. – Ellen Leabeater, audio producer

People around the world are feeling rudderless and adrift. There’s conflicting information about the pandemic – but it’s not just about health. People losing work, feeling frightened, being isolated at home, worried about their loved ones and wondering about getting basic supplies.
We all must make ethical decisions in this pandemic. Should I take that second pack of toilet paper for my family, or leave it for the next? Should essential workers stay home to protect themselves?
Responses are varied. Some people are showing grace under pressure. Some are responding with shock or panic, others seem to be wilfully ignoring the situation. Many have never experienced this type of crisis before, others are finding their traditional roadmaps breaking down: churches empty, political leaders losing trust, supermarkets ransacked, neighbours “sheltering in place” behind closed doors.
The more we read, the more anxious we become.
Stoicism is an ancient tool for remaining calm in adversity. Often dumbed down to refer to having a stiff upper lip, or emotional reserve, Stoicism is actually a deep philosophical framework, useful in providing an ethical scaffold for both everyday life and in times of difficulty.
Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that was founded by Zeno of Citium, in Athens, in the early 3rd century BC.
Stoics welcomed hard times – they saw their life as training for moments such as the one we are in now, where character, resilience and courage are tested. Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: “The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skilful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.”
He saw crisis as a way of unmasking who you really are: “Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.”
In times like this it’s easy to spiral into anxiety. The Stoics strived for tranquility and believed that our minds are powerful and create their own heaven or hell. Stoics such as the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius lived through the Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, an ancient pandemic that wiped out a third of the population. Philosopher and playwright Seneca had to deal at close range with despots such as Caligula and Nero (who eventually ordered his death), and both Marcus Aurelius and Seneca had to carry on after the death of their children.
A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus
They were calm, focused and courageous in the face of carnage. Seneca said: “We are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in the imagination than reality.”
Stoics prized rational thinking, acting on good information and contemplating the situation fully rather than acting rashly or from a place of panic and anxiety. Marcus Aurelius coped by not allowing his thoughts to be overrun by negativity. “The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make of it,” he wrote in his nightly diary. Those in quarantine in Wuhan also kept a diary as a way of coping.
A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus. Counselled Epictetus: “Other people’s views and troubles can be contagious. Don’t sabotage yourself by unwittingly adopting negative, unproductive attitudes through your associations with others.”
The Stoics believed that humans as social animals were created to support each other. Marcus Aurelius devoted himself to “do good to my fellow creatures and bear with them.”
No plague or injury can do your more damage than you do to yourself through acts of bad character. Character is key for the Stoics. They believed that your health and your money can be taken away from you at any time – but no one can take your character from you. So you need to nurture it. It’s particularly important at times of global emergency where we need to pull together.
Demonstrating good character might involve not hoarding scarce goods such as toilet paper. It might mean not taking all the pasta and rice for yourself and leaving none for others. It might mean self-isolating not just for your own protection but to protect others. 
“Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness,” said Seneca.
When people in northern Italy escaped quarantine despite being ordered to do so, they spread the virus across the country, imperilling other communities. They acted out of fear and didn’t consider the wider good when taking action. 
Ancient Stoics recognised humans are highly social animals, and we exist and find meaning within our communities. Their philosophy reflected our deep and profound interconnectedness. According to Seneca, “we are waves of the same sea, leaves of the same tree, flowers of the same garden.”
It was no coincidence that when the Chinese sent boxes of medical supplies and face masks to Italy last week, the crates were all stamped with this quote.
As many of us lock down and go into social isolation to try to contain the spread of the virus, we are fearful about how we might cope for an indefinite period of time away from our friend, pleasures, routines and social life.
The Stoics have a lot to teach us about surviving quarantine – after all, a lot of them were exiled by angry rulers, and faced years trapped in a place and situation not of their choosing.
One of the most important Stoic teachers from ancient Rome, Gaius Musonius Rufus, was exiled to the small and desert-like island of Gyaros (in 65, the same year Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide). Seneca previously was exiled by Claudius to Corsica for eight years, just when his star was on the rise in ancient Rome.
Rather than being bitter at his fall from grace, Seneca used his time in exile to enjoy the natural world and think about the nature of life.
“Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company,” he said.
It also taught him that a bit of deprivation can be an excellent corrective – as you realise in good times you often become habituated to living a soft, decadent life.
In letters to his friend Lucilius, he wrote: “Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realise how unnecessary many things are. We’ve been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.”
When Boris Johnson said last week, “I must level with you, many families, many more families are going to lose loved ones” due to Covid-19, he was (maybe unwittingly) employing the Stoic technique of negative visualisation.
This technique involves thinking about what you value most in life, then imagine losing that thing. It might range from losing a precious piece of jewellery right through to imagining someone you love dying – in this case, dying from the virus.
Negative visualisation was practised by Stoics for a couple of reasons. This includes not only inoculating us to inevitable loss in life, but also enabling us to appreciate the people and things we love. Stoics believed that we are less likely to take someone for granted if we are aware that they may not be in our life forever. We might all be quarantined for quite a while. There are worse uses of your time than reading the Stoics. They have a lot to teach us.

I have a job in China and left just before the coronavirus outbreak to visit my parents in the US. My wife, a Chinese citizen, wants me to return to meet her at our  apartment in a major Chinese city not far from the first afflicted province of Hubei, so that we can weather the crisis together. She believes that our life shouldn’t be put on hold for weeks or months, and that our different experiences of the outbreak might be pushing us apart. I’m eager to get back to her as soon as possible but worried that my travelling will endanger us both, not to mention cause  anxiety to my dad who is already struggling with serious health issues. On top of this, my government has advised strongly against travel to China and my boss has offered me a way to do my work online. How can I find a path towards making the right decision for myself, my wife and our marriage?
Did you see those huge lines at airports this week, hundreds of passengers crammed shoulder to shoulder so that customs halls around the world looked like livestock pens? Like you, I’d thought about being in those lines. I had thought that I needed to fly home to my parents and my grandparents while I still could, and that if anything happened to them while I was away I could never live with myself. Then I remembered that to pass through an airport right now is to endanger someone else’s loved one. This thing moves so fast, and tests have been so slow, that we simply do not know what each of us is carrying. Patient 31 in South Korea went to church twice and infected 1,000 people.
Once you grasp that moving around right now imposes risk on others, there’s no question left about whether it’s fair to do it, even so we can get back to our people. It’s not. Don’t travel unless you absolutely have to.
I know I’m asking a lot of you here. You asked how to make the best decision for yourself, your wife and your marriage, and instead I’m asking you to make this decision for people you’ve never met.
Your wife might be angry if you tell her you’re putting strangers over what she wants, and normally I’d think she was right. But we have to start caring about strangers, richly caring – caring in the way that makes us prepared to put their wellbeing before our own. What will unite us right now, and God knows we could use it, is finally seeing each other as worth making sacrifices for.
I am confident that patient 31 felt just like you and me: scared, lonely and wanting the joy and reassurance of a familiar group of people. Now thousands more are in danger who didn’t need to be.
It’s hard to realise while we’re in their grip but thoughts like “this will be really hard” and “I want to be around my people” don’t make us special exemptions from the collective, they throw us right in the thick of it.
There’s something galvanising about that; we can keep each other mentally in our pockets as we do the hard, boring, lonely things we will have to in the coming months. Somewhere I’ll wash my hands for you, while you stay home for me. I’ll think of your grandmother while I’m freezing a batch of soup and you think of mine while you bounce a tennis ball off the wall.
It’s a dusty adage (the best ones often are) that we reveal ourselves when we’re tested. Let the part of you that this crisis illuminates be a part that you’re proud of – one that takes other people as seriously as you hope to be taken.

'It's really irresponsible': pop stars criticise fans over coronavirus inaction

Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande are among the pop stars using their considerable clout with fans to appeal for behavioural change during the coronavirus outbreak.
Eilish delivered a five-minute Instagram story to her 57 million followers, saying: “I’ve seen a lot of young people out in the world, all over the place, going to the club or going to the beach or just going out and hanging out, and it’s really irresponsible.” She highlighted that young fans could pass it to more vulnerable relatives, and added: “Please take responsibility for your endurance of this.”
Swift spoke to her 128.2m Instagram followers to say: “I love you guys so much and need to express my concern that things aren’t being taken seriously enough right now … I’m seeing lots of get-togethers and hangs and parties still happening. This is the time to cancel plans. Don’t assume that because you don’t feel sick that you aren’t possibly passing something on to someone elderly or vulnerable to this.”
On Sunday, Grande wrote to her 72m Twitter followers: “I keep hearing from a surprising amount of people statements like ‘This isn’t a big deal’… it is incredibly selfish and dangerous to take this situation that lightly. The ‘We will be fine because we’re young’ mindset is putting people who aren’t young and/or healthy in a lot of danger. You sound stupid and privileged and you need to care more about others. Like now.”

US singer Camila Cabello said: “Especially as young people, even if we are healthy, it’s important to practice compassion and help others that could be suffering. We are in this together, let’s not be indifferent to others’ risk.” She advised her 48m Instagram followers to practise meditation to help quell any anxiety.
Their appeals come as other music stars have been criticised for going ahead with concerts during the crisis. Welsh indie band Stereophonics played a series of arena concerts over the weekend, attracting tens of thousands of fans, and defended the decision by saying: “The UK government’s position was that at this phase there was no need for a ban on large public gatherings. Acting on this guidance, we continued with the last three shows of our UK tour on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, as did many other events across the entertainment industry.”
Scottish pop singer Lewis Capaldi used the same reasoning for playing an arena concert after Scotland announced the cancellation of large-scale events but before the ban came into force.
A spokesperson said of the Scottish government’s advisory document: “The advice applies from Monday March 16, and is ‘not expected to have a significant impact on the spread of Covid-19, and this is not its purpose’, but that it aims ‘to relieve pressure on public services, including emergency services’. Security, first aid, medical and welfare teams were paid for by the organisers as normal and the venue had additional signage in place to highlight best practice on hygiene during the event.”
Tens of major tours have been cancelled, including those by Elton John, Foo Fighters and Celine Dion.
Stars are now looking to livestreaming as an alternative. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin took to Instagram Live yesterday to perform his band’s songs as well as a cover of David Bowie’s Life on Mars. “Maybe 9/11 was the last time I felt like we were all together,” he said.
The performance was part of a new initiative from the World Health Organization and Global Citizen called Together, at Home. John Legend is the next performer lined up for the series."

Bernard Tomic endures blizzard of uncharitable scorn in self-isolation

When Bernard Tomic announced he was the first player on the ATP tour to self-isolate after showing symptoms of coronavirus, the 27-year-old Australian was not drowned in universal sympathy.
The Covid-19 pandemic has loosened the worst and best instincts of humanity and Tomic, who could have been one of the outstanding players of his generation, endured mostly a blizzard of scorn after telling an Australian newspaper on Sunday: “Since Tuesday, I started feeling not right. I already had shortness of breath and my immune system was low and run down. I’m currently in Miami and isolated away from everyone, as advised. I’m yet to be tested for [Covid-19] but I have all the symptoms.”
He will not lack for expert advice close to home; his mother, Ady, was a biomedical scientist. Quite what his belligerent father, John, will tell him is another matter.
Tomic believes he may have been infected while flying to Florida from one of his favourite tournaments, Monterrey, where he lost against his compatriot Aleksandar Vukic in the third round. But most fans were not interested. Tomic, who rose to a career-high 17 in the world in 2016 and now wallows at 200, could not buy a friend. 
The social media onslaught was relentless. “I think he’s just had dickheaditis,” said one. “Since when did he become Dr Bernard Tomic?” asked another. There were a slew of laughing memes and gifs, as well as abuse and nastiness. “Let’s hope he stays there forever,” was typical. One budding comedian observed: “Apparently he was lethargic, tired and could not chase the tennis ball. It was a wonder he was diagnosed at all, no difference to his normal behaviour.”
He has heard it for years. It was uncharitable, obviously, and, sadly, predictable. It confirmed what is obvious: memories can be short and unkind, especially when the target is a celebrity athlete with a history of entitlement and ordinary behaviour.
It should have been – and could have been – different. However, it was evident from the start of his career that Tomic was temperamentally ill-equipped to handle fame. He blundered from one minor public relations disaster to another, losing to players way below him in the rankings, and seeming not to care, as the money rolled in.
When Mischa Zverev blew him away in less than an hour-and-a-half in the first round at Wimbledon three years ago, he said he had no regrets, was bored and did not much like tennis. “Throughout my career I’ve given 100%,” he said. “I’ve given also 30%.” He then blew it up altogether: “Wouldn’t anyone want to take a job in ... one of the biggest sports in the world and only give 50, 60% and earn millions of dollars?”
His website has been dormant for years. The last result posted was his injury retirement after three games against Benoît Paire in the first round of the 2016 Italian Open. It was one of many such results, seen by his team as evidence of a failing body and zero focus, by his critics as a deficit of spirit.
On Facebook, he often showed his good side. His last entry, in February 2013, captioned a visit to a children’s hospital: “La Timone in Marseille this week, really enjoyed the experience – chatting and signing autographs with the kids.”
Not a lot has gone right for Tomic since he came through qualifying to take a set off Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2011. That might have been his breakthrough moment, as fans thrilled to his languid game. He showed exquisite touches and bursts of lazy power but not enough resilience under pressure when Djokovic stepped on the gas. Still, it was something memorable for a teenager to build on.
In fits and starts, injury and hubris undermined his talent thereafter. Arrogance and ignorance did not help. He went from prodigy to Tomic the Tank Engine. Patrick and John McEnroe called him out at Flushing Meadows in 2012 when he collapsed spectacularly against Andy Roddick. Tomic responded: “That’s how I play. Do you have a problem with that?”
For all his flaws and wasted gifts, he surely does not deserve the vilification that has fallen upon him in a health crisis such as the one he is enduring now. “People need to take this super seriously,” he told the Sydney Sun-Herald, “especially at home in Australia. I don’t know how long I’ll be in isolation or when I can be tested.”
Tomic may not realise it but he has been isolated for many years."

This summer’s European Championship has been postponed until 2021, Uefa has decided, as it contemplates the unprecedented disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
European football’s governing body is also hoping to complete all domestic club competitions and the Champions League and Europa League by 30 June, subject to the situation improving. This could lead to Champions and Europa League games being played at weekends, it said.
Uefa held its scheduled conference call with the continent’s 55 national football associations at noon UK time and 17 minutes later the Norwegian FA was the first to tweet the news that the tournament has been postponed until next year. Shortly after 2pm GMT, Uefa confirmed the news in a statement.
The proposed new dates are Friday 11 June until Sunday 11 July 2021, with decisions on dates for other club and international competitions for men or women to “be taken and announced in due course”.
“We are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent,” said the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin. “It is at times like these, that the football community needs to show responsibility, unity, solidarity and altruism.
“The health of fans, staff and players has to be our No 1 priority and in that spirit, Uefa tabled a range of options so that competitions can finish this season safely and I am proud of the response of my colleagues across European football. There was a real spirit of co-operation, with everyone recognising that they had to sacrifice something in order to achieve the best result.”
The tournament was due to have been held this year from 12 June to 12 July in cities of 12 countries right across Europe, including London, Glasgow and Dublin. Wembley was due to host seven matches, including the semi-finals and the final.
The postponement was widely expected after national leagues and Uefa’s own Champions League and Europa League club competitions were suspended last week and Europe became locked down by severe travel and social restrictions.
It emerged on Tuesday that Uefa last week cancelled its hotel bookings in Copenhagen, one of the host cities. The CPH Hotel told Reuters that Uefa had booked 80 of its 102 rooms but cancelled them a little over a week ago. The Marienlyst Strandhotel told Reuters that Uefa had cancelled rooms booked on behalf of the Denmark team, who are usually based there.
The postponement of the Euros potentially frees a month this summer to try to finish club competitions, which the Premier League, EFL and all European leagues hope to do, but this remains highly uncertain as it is impossible to know when normal life, including football and other sports, can resume.
The European Club Association (ECA), European Leagues and the international players’ union were involved in separate video-conference calls with Uefa after the first one with the 55 FAs, to discuss the possibilities for domestic competitions, and the Champions and Europa Leagues.
There are implications for other international competitions too. Uefa confirmed that the women’s European Championship, which had been due to take place from 7 July to 1 August in England next year, would be rescheduled, together with the Nations League finals and the European Under-21 Championship in Hungary and Slovenia.

The FA’s CEO, Mark Bullingham, said: “People’s health and wellbeing has to be the primary concern for us all, so we fully support Uefa’s decision to postpone Euro 2020. We will be considering the implications for all England teams and our organisation over the coming days, including any implications on the date of the 2021 women’s Euro which we are very proud to be hosting. We will continue to work in collaboration with the PL, EFL and our football partners on the scenarios that could follow Uefa’s decision today.”
The ECA said it would be part of a working group co-ordinated by Uefa “to develop and shape the practicalities around managing the calendar to maximise the chances of concluding the remaining club games of the 2019-20 season and tackle the wider consequences of COVID-19 on the game”.
In a statement, Football Supporters Europe, a collective of recognised fans organisations including the Football Supporters’ Association for England and Wales, said in a statement: “FSE commends Uefa for making a clear and timely decision to postpone Euro 2020. Together with the commitment to refund tickets, this will limit the financial impact on travelling fans.”
This year’s Copa América has also been postponed until 2021 by the South American Football Federation. “This is an extraordinary measure for an unexpected situation and responds to the fundamental need to avoid the exponential evolution of the virus,” said Conmebol’s president Alejandro Domínguez. That tournament is also now scheduled to be staged between 11 June and 11 July 2021.
The African Nations Championship, scheduled for April in Cameroon, has been postponed indefinitely, the African Football Federation said."

'Will we have to strike?' Football in Brazil continues despite coronavirus
",By Joshua Law for Yellow & Green Football,"Some matches in Brazil have been called off but the response to the pandemic has been slow and inconsistent

On Sunday morning in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, Grêmio players and coaching staff emerged from the tunnel at their empty stadium wearing surgical masks in protest at having to fulfil their Campeonato Gaúcho fixture against São Luiz despite the coronavirus pandemic. While many countries have brought a halt to all sporting activities, Brazilian football has been slow and inconsistent in its reaction to the pandemic.
Later on Sunday, the national football confederation, the CBF, released a statement announcing that all national competitions would be suspended indefinitely and with immediate effect. Ongoing tournaments under their jurisdiction include the first and second divisions of women’s Brazilian championship, as well as the men’s U17 national championship and men’s U20 Brazilian Cup. Yet the men’s senior game in Brazil is in the midst of the state championship season and the power to suspend those competitions rests with local federations rather than the CBF.
After meetings on Sunday and Monday, some state federations have now taken decisive action. On Sunday night, the Minas Gerais federation put games on hold indefinitely from Tuesday. On Monday, the federations in São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Maranhão followed suit. The Alagoas, Pará, Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro federations, meanwhile, have suspended activities for 15 days. But without consensus across the country on how to proceed, football is yet to stop in all regions.
The economy cannot stop. It will generate unemployment.
For players, club employees and many commentators, the authorities have already taken, and in some cases continue to take, unnecessary risks. “The countries that are containing the situation are those that adopt strong measures”, said Grêmio vice-president Paulo Luz. “We must prioritise life.” Similar scenes to those at the Arena do Grêmio played out in Rio de Janeiro later on Sunday, as Vasco da Gama and Botafogo players lined up before their respective games with protective masks on their faces. Botafogo players carried a banner that pointedly read, “Coronavirus: protect yourself! This fight belongs to all of us.”
In both Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, matches were already being played behind closed doors as a precaution over the weekend. On Friday, Rio de Janeiro state governor Wilson Witzel said: “With closed gates, there is no agglomeration of people. On the contact between players… that’s their risk.” Vasco defender Leandro Castán responded sarcastically to Witzel, tweeting, “The risk is ours, great response, great governor, thanks for your respect with the players!!!”
Stadiums were also closed in the city of São Paulo, the centre of infections in the country. The derby between São Paulo and Santos took place in a deserted Morumbi stadium and Corinthians played Ituano at home with recordings of singing fans being played over the speaker system at high volume.
1T | 08 min: Sem torcida? Se liga no sistema de som da @A_Corinthians! #SCCPxITU (0x0)#NarraComigo#VaiCorinthians pic.twitter.com/106Hv91LE0
Yet, elsewhere in São Paulo state and in numerous states from Santa Catarina in the south to Mato Grosso do Sul in the west, Pará in the north and Pernambuco in the north east, games went ahead as usual, with tickets sold and fans occupying, if not entirely filling, the terraces. Authorities in many of Brazil’s 26 states are still reluctant to suspend games. In Amapá, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pernambuco and Ceará the federations have announced that the local championships will continue without the presence of fans. Others prevaricate over the situation. 
André Pitta, president of the state football federation of Goiás, said on Sunday: “Our position is to maintain the championship behind closed doors. We will have a meeting with the clubs before the end of the week, without rushing, with tranquility, to evaluate the situation. The CBF’s decision is different from that with regards to the state championship.”
Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro supported Pitta’s stance and criticised the CBF’s approach in an interview with CNN on Sunday evening. “When you prohibit football matches, you are approaching hysteria,” he declared. “I don’t want that.” He said the CBF could instead “sell a percentage of the tickets, taking into account the quantity of people in the stands, and not immediately prohibit this or that, because cancelling [football] will not contain the spread. The economy cannot stop. It will generate unemployment.”
O Globo columnist Martín Fernández disagrees. “Stop everything as soon as possible,” he suggests. “That is what specialists who study the subject recommend. Playing games without fans does not make sense – the meeting up of people in the stadium or around the television is the reason the game exists. Playing without fans is encouraging people to move around and meet up. And that is an error.”
Yet the power in Brazilian football, and the jurisdiction in this matter, remains in the hands of the state federations. If they do not all, individually, see fit to suspend games, then football will continue.
While things remain up in the air, players, coaches and club directors are understandably concerned. Grêmio manager Renato Portaluppi used a post-match interview on Sunday to question those in power, saying: “Is it not the case that Brazilian football must stop? The whole world has stopped. Will we have to go on strike?” Meanwhile, the Internacional midfielder Damián Musto displayed his dismay by tweeting: “What are they waiting for? Stop everything, hijos de puta! They play with lives as if it were a video game. Stop before it is too late!”
In Ceará, the federation’s decision to maintain the football calendar was supported by the presidents of the two big local clubs, Ceará and Fortaleza. But the president of the professional footballers’ union said his members were unhappy. “Despite players being young and healthy, they are not immune from the virus,” he said. “A football match, even without a crowd, moves at least 200 people, many of an advanced age, who according to official data are the worst affected by the virus.”
Juca Kfouri, the doyen of Brazilian football writing, expressed his view in the daily paper Folha: “There is nothing that justifies playing games without fans, and even less submitting the players to the risk of coronavirus. Wash your hands, do not touch people near you, keep your distance and … gooool!!!” Brazil’s football-watching public waits to see how much longer it will take before players are no longer forced to play and commentators are no longer screaming that last word over the airwaves.

Australian rugby heads for world of pain as financial impact of coronavirus is felt

Australian rugby was already sickly before the coronavirus swept the world, but after Sanzaar suspended the Super Rugby competition for the “foreseeable future”, the game in Australia will be on life support if the pandemic does not end soon.
Australian rugby has been placed on the brink of bankruptcy. Unlike its major rivals – Australian rules and rugby league – the 15-a-side code does not have a war chest to help it ride out the crisis.
But it did not have to be that way if things had been done differently 17 years ago. Rugby Australia received a $44m windfall from hosting the 2003 World Cup. Former RA chief-executive John O’Neill intended to invest the bonanza in a future fund similar to the one the Australian Olympic Committee set up after the Sydney Games.
But the game’s stakeholders all wanted their slice of the pie and RA’s reserves have dwindled rather than grown, reportedly down to below $18m. RA’s treasury has been largely drained by bailing out cash-strapped Super Rugby clubs, who no longer have a bank of last resort to rely on.
If wisely invested, who knows what that $44m would have been worth now at a time when the economy of the game is about to collapse because of a virus.
The suspension of the Super Rugby season is expected to cost Australia’s four teams – the Brumbies, Melbourne Rebels, NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds – millions of dollars in lost revenue, money they don’t have in their bank accounts.
RA and Sanzaar officials have been meeting since Sunday to try to work out how to salvage something from the crisis. Indications are that RA are considering playing local Super Rugby derbies, including matches with the dumped Western Force, to keep players fit and to maintain some cash flow.
It would be like a beefed-up version of the second-tier National Rugby Championship with Wallabies and leading Super Rugby players involved, but is unlikely to be the financial saviour of Super Rugby alone.
With a federal government ban on crowds of more than 500, any games would be played in empty stadiums, which means no gate-money. And there is also the possibility sponsors will pull out. 
If Australia were forced into an Italian-style lock-down because of the coronavirus, there could be restrictions on interstate travel, which would prevent teams playing against each other unless they all domiciled in one city.
There was talk of Super Rugby players playing in the Sydney and Brisbane premier club competitions, but RA has cancelled all community rugby until 2 May for health reasons, which begs the question: why should professional players be expected to play if it is too risky for amateurs?
Part of the reason would be to keep players active in the unlikely event Super Rugby resumed before the finals in June, but rugby administrators may also be anxious about providing content for broadcaster Fox Sports.
Will Fox Sports demand a refund on its $57m payment to broadcast Super Rugby if it can only show local derbies or no games at all? This is a time when there needs to be close cooperation between professional sports and their broadcast partners.
The disruption of the competition comes at a delicate time as RA attempts to re-negotiate its broadcast rights. Relations with Fox Sports have already been strained by RA’s decision to take the rights to an open tender. Optus appears to be the front-runner to pick up the rights, but it is yet to be seen how the shutdown will influence the telecommunication company’s thinking about the game and the price it is prepared to pay.
If there are no more Super Rugby games this year, or even a few local derbies, questions will be raised about how clubs can survive financially. RA – and perhaps the individual franchises – will no doubt seek government handouts, but they will need to get in the queue. Every business in the land, sporting or otherwise, will be putting their hand up, and rugby may not be high on the government’s list of priorities.
Perhaps RA could appeal to World Rugby, which was expected to rake in $US449m in commercial revenues from the 2019 World Cup in Japan. But once again, every union around the globe would need to get in line.
Australian rugby will be in a world of pain over the next few months and that pain will need to be shared if the game is to survive. A huge amount of a Super Rugby club’s budget is absorbed by player payments. If players on million-dollar contracts are not playing, or not playing in front of crowds, it is reasonable they take a pay cut, but chief-executives and coaches should set an example.
A crisis can be a transformative event. When Australian rugby returns to some kind of normality, assuming it ever does, it will need to think about doing things differently in the future. And if Australian rugby should ever receive another windfall like it did in 2003, it will have to invest it in a wealth fund to protect the game against future shocks."

AFLW community rallies in face of coronavirus-impacted season

Kasey Symons","Fans are locked out due to the pandemic, but the league’s strong fanbase is no stranger to adversity

We live in undoubtedly strange times. There aren’t answers to many questions about the ongoing effects of the coronavirus at the moment, but one thing is certain when it comes to its impact on the AFLW competition.
“What we know is the footy community is strong,” said Emma Race during the ABC’s The Outer Sanctum radio show on Saturday morning. “The AFLW community faces adversity together all the time.”
Last weekend’s round saw the AFL take the unprecedented step of barring fans from games, following Friday night’s match between Geelong and North Melbourne. That match is now likely to be the last opened to fans this season; all others have been restricted to players, staff and media, leaving most to follow from their couches and interact with other fans not on the perimeter, but through their phones.
The AFLW’s online fanbase has flourished since the inception of the league and, through the likes of The Outer Sanctum team, it is able to connect and share experiences while still supporting from home. 
The sense of community fostered through social media in women’s sport is special. It has given many fans a space to occupy and connect to others in an inclusive and celebratory way that has often been denied when entering the fan space of traditional men’s sports. 
At the weekend, The Outer Sanctum led the charge, calling for people from the outer – the people they have connected to through their radio show and podcast – to celebrate their teams and favourite players. Fans came together to recreate the fun and inclusive experience of a match day experience through social media. It was a significant antidote to the worry and fear of the current climate.
The weekend’s virus-impacted round was not the first time these fans have rallied together in the best way. This week marks the one-year anniversary of the night a photo of Carlton forward Tayla Harris was posted, viciously trolled, removed and reposted because of the response of a unified and passionate fanbase. It changed the narrative and the course of Harris’s career as she leant into the moment to use her platform as a driver for social change. 
While the photo signifies the power of a collective of marginalised voices, and the strength of community that exists in the outer of the AFLW, it still has significant challenges.
When it was announced that fans would not have access to AFLW matches after Friday night’s game, out came the trolls to use the space to provide sexist comments about attendance figures in the women’s game. This was not limited to anonymous accounts; high-profile figures, some who even hold public office, also chose to weigh in.
Harris has continued to campaign for more social media monitoring. She has indicated that, while her photo and what it now stands for is still a powerful reminder of the events that occurred and what was subsequently achieved through collective online action, there is still much to do.
God damn I’ll give up my AFLW wage to employ someone to monitor this, public bullying is a ripple effect to young people in schools and communities that lead to mental health issues and suicide. 2/2
This space has the potential to become more vulnerable during a time of self-isolation and social distancing. It has been a sanctuary for many women’s sports fans, but it can also be confronting and dangerous with very real life impacts when it comes to mental health and wellbeing.
Sports administrators have a mountain of work ahead of them during this difficult time. Those in positions of power will not be envied for the decisions they are going to have to make, that will have consequences for thousands of people in their community. It might not seem important, but digital spaces will play a huge role in helping to keep these people connected and engaged. This presents sport with unique opportunities.
Fans are not going anywhere and will remain connected to the sports they love as long as they continue to be played in a safe way. Interaction with fans can keep the sense of game-day fan experience alive and thriving during this difficult time, but also keep their fans safe in a very different, but still very powerful way."

","The truth is the Covid-19 test doesn’t change anything. Even without it we can all make a difference now • Australia coronavirus live: NSW government announces $2.3bn stimulus package
I’m standing at the entrance of a Covid-19 testing unit for a major Sydney hospital, being quizzed by a nurse about my symptoms.
“I’m sorry,”, she says. “I’ve had a lot of people lying to me to try to get tested. I have to be careful.”
It soon becomes clear that I meet the criteria for testing for coronavirus and I’m given a sticker with a number on it.
I join a quiet room full of people, each with a mask and a sticker. Staff members, wearing protective gloves, gowns, face masks and eye covering, are coming around to get each person’s details. Next, your “vital signs” – that is your heart and breathing rate, temperature, oxygenation and blood pressure – are recorded.
The woman sitting next to me sniffs loudly, then sneezes, and I shift uncomfortably in my chair. Being in a room full of people who all certainly have viruses and may possibly have Covid-19, is not relaxing. I think about how many items of my clothing, my bag and my umbrella are touching the area around me, and I wonder idly about how long the virus lasts on surfaces and if it can transfer from surface to surface.
Suddenly, the explosive cough that has been surprising me all week bursts once again from my mouth. My neighbour who sneezed earlier startles and shifts away from me in her chair. I don’t blame her. We are close together and I could feel my breath forcefully pushing out the sides of my mask.
After half an hour we are moved to a different set of chairs, waiting to move through to the testing area.
If you are worried you have coronavirus, you should act as if you do have it
At this point I realise I am one of the lucky ones. By now the line outside the clinic is snaking around the corner. As each new person gets to the front, they are imploring the nurse to let them in.
“But my friend was travelling and she is sick!”
“I’ve been living in a hotel and I don’t know who was there!”
Many respond with anger when she advises them they don’t meet guidelines for testing, that they should go home, self-isolate until their symptoms subside or they are advised otherwise. That they are better off not sitting in a room surrounded by sick people for two hours.
“Are you seriously telling me you don’t care about this??!” one man exclaims.
“But my work says I need a certificate to come in,” begs another.
Most are scared. They want to get tested because they want reassurance in what is frankly a confusing, unsettling time.
Ideally we would test people as widely as possible, but at the moment Australia is one of many countries affected by a worldwide shortage of testing kits. There is a real opportunity cost to testing people who don’t meet the criteria. In some labs they are being forced to delay or stop other important tests because they simply don’t have the resources to meet demand.
When it’s finally time to be tested, my details and symptoms are recorded again by another gowned staff member before I’m taken into a testing room. One swab (which looks like a giant cotton bud) is held at a right angle to my head and pushed inside my nostril, further back than it seems possible to go. It feels scratchy and sore just above my throat. Then the same swab is used again in the other side, before being placed in a bag and sent off. The whole thing takes only a couple of minutes but consumes a large amount of staff time and personal protective equipment.
Afterwards, my throat and nose are sore. And I feel oddly marked. Like somehow just by virtue of taking the test my status as a potential carrier has changed.
But the truth is, the test doesn’t change anything.
So if you don’t meet the criteria for testing right now, don’t panic.
There is still so much you can do. If you are worried you have coronavirus, you should act as if you do have it. Self-isolate. Be meticulous with hand-washing. Having a positive test won’t get you any better treatment in any way.
If you or someone you employ has viral symptoms, now is the time for you to show moral leadership. Don’t turn up at these overrun testing centres unless you meet the testing criteria for your state. Don’t require your employees to be tested or get a medical certificate. Just let them stay at home.
Two hours in a testing centre and an uncomfortable swab up the nose won’t change anything. If you become very unwell you will be managed the same way, and you will be tested anyway. Even without the tests, we can all make a difference now.

The coronavirus pandemic has shown us all in just a few days how fragile our way of life really is. Basic certainties about our health, that of our loved ones and our normal way of life can no longer be taken for granted. Our sense of anxiety is real and understandable.
In these new circumstances, the most important and hardest thing for government is to not cling to old certainties about the way things should be done, but to tear up the rulebook. That is what we have started to see in the last few days when it comes to public health measures. There is now a desperate urgency that this scale of action is matched by the government’s economic response. We are not there yet – not by a long way.
The government should act as a guarantor for a portion of the wages for all those businesses affected. It would be radical, but necessary
No individual, business, worker or charity must be left to bear the risk and consequences of the economic impact on their own. A pandemic is the ultimate collective action problem: we are in this together and it must be managed collectively by government.
We cannot say to our pubs, small businesses, cinemas, theatres that we want them empty and then leave them and their employees to face the consequences. If we do, we will face bankrupt businesses and laid-off workers at a scale that will cause misery and hardship throughout our country.
Nor can we leave all the other businesses affected to fend for themselves. We cannot say to the 5 million self-employed people that if they have no work or get sick, they must face the consequences alone. Nor can we say to the millions of workers who live pay cheque to pay cheque that £93.50 a week statutory sick pay is enough to get them through.
This crisis reveals some of the gaping holes in our social safety net. It is both right in principle and necessary for the public health measures to mend those holes at speed. If we want people to self-isolate if they have symptoms, or if someone in their family does, we need to make it economically possible for them to do so.
First, we need action at a scale that is commensurate with the economic costs of the crisis. While estimates are hard to make, the loss in demand that is likely to occur will, without action, cause a very deep recession. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has made available support that amounted to hundreds of billions of euros of help. Given how quickly the crisis is moving, last Wednesday’s budget provided only a fraction of what is required.
Second, we need action at speed. A crucial test of any new measure proposed is how quickly it can have an effect. It takes much longer than you might think to design new systems of payments or support. Workers and businesses need help in days not months.
Third, we need scope of action that covers all at-risk workers and businesses. Ireland has shown what is possible with a new special unemployment insurance payment. Denmark has gone further with its government guaranteeing 75% of wages for private sector workers who would otherwise be made redundant. Given that we expect this crisis to be temporary, we need to keep workers attached to their firms if at all possible.
In the interests of scale, speed and scope, we should turn statutory sick pay into employment retention pay, available to all those workers whose businesses have had to cease their activities or substantially reduce them as a result of the crisis – not just to those workers who are sick. It should be paid at a substantially higher level than now to enable families to make ends meet, either as a flat rate payment or a proportion of previous earnings, say 75%, up to a cap, as in Denmark.
There are different ideas for supporting the economy, including a temporary universal basic income, and nothing should be ruled out. But as the Resolution Foundation has suggested, employment retention pay has the virtue that the mechanism to make this payment already exists, it will cover all employed workers affected by the crisis, and it will cover a substantial proportion of employer costs. It will keep families afloat and prop up demand, helping businesses.
The government would essentially be acting as a guarantor for a portion of the wages for all those businesses affected by the crisis and unable to operate. Such action would be radical, but it is necessary.
Clearly, however, it does not cover the self-employed. Just because people work for themselves, they should not be left on their own. Here we need to fix the fact that universal credit at £73 a week is simply not enough for many people to live on and risks deepening the drop in demand. The crisis has shone a light on this fact. Universal credit needs to be substantially increased and available immediately, to help the individuals concerned and prop up the economy.
Finally we need to support businesses and charities in the costs they face over and above the costs of their workers. At the very least, we need a generous interest-free loan system to keep them afloat, but this could leave them debt-burdened when we emerge from the crisis. In France, businesses are being allowed to suspend rent payments and payments for gas and electricity.
Of course, there are substantial costs involved with all these measures. But it is absolutely necessary to act. If we do not, there will not just be millions of people who will face poverty and hardship, to add to the health consequences of the pandemic, but it will lead to long-term economic effects, from which it will take years to recover. Further action may also be necessary as well as these immediate measures.
This is a moment that tests our political leadership. We need imagination, compassion and action. There is not a moment to lose.

Trump sees the coronavirus as a threat to his self-interest – not to people

","Trump has made it clear he sees this pandemic chiefly as a threat to the market and wealthy people’s interests (and relatedly, his political future)
A fictional film about a US president mismanaging the response to a dangerous pandemic would never depict its lead character anywhere near as selfish and bumbling as Donald Trump in the age of Covid-19. He’d be too cartoonish and inept to be believable.
And yet, here we are. At a press conference on Sunday – the same day that state governors declared closures of bars and restaurants and when the Covid-19 death count shot up in Italy – the American president spent more time gushing over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut, heaping praise on big corporate retailers for keeping Americans well-supplied, and praising Friday’s rise in the stock market (“almost 2,000 points!”) than, say, addressing the health concerns of the public.
Trump’s response goes beyond incompetence – it’s a political abomination. However uncoordinated his administration’s moves have been, Trump has made it clear he sees this pandemic chiefly as a threat to the market and wealthy people’s personal interests (and relatedly, his own political future) – not to the people whose lives it will threaten or claim.
“What’s happened with the Fed is phenomenal news,” Trump gushed at the press conference, “what’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news!” “Relax,” he later continued, “we’re doing great, it all will pass.” These words hardly matched the reality on the ground, as Covid-19 was shutting down whole nations across Europe, and American hospitals were cancelling elective surgeries to prepare for a potential surge of the critically ill.
Trump and his allies’ impulse to protect the powerful led the administration to undercut the nation’s public health infrastructure long before the rise of coronavirus – a fact that helps contextualize his response today. For instance, he signed an executive order in January 2017 that froze hiring of federal workers, leading to almost 700 vacancies at the Centers of Disease Control (CDC); some such positions were at a key department that “regulates some of the world’s most dangerous bacteria and viruses and manages the nation’s stockpile of emergency medical countermeasures”, the Washington Post reported.
That same year, Trump and congressional Republicans nearly succeeded in passing a bill that would have gutted Medicaid – and that also would have eliminated the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the source of 12% of the CDC’s budget. Such cuts had one big beneficiary: corporations and the very wealthy, who would have seen big tax cuts had the repeal legislation passed. Later, in 2018, it disbanded the White House’s pandemic office charged with responding to outbreaks like Covid-19 – putting no leadership structure in its place.
Since the pandemic began, the administration has hardly reprioritized. As Politico’s Dan Diamond reported, Trump opposed evacuating a cruise ship that was stuck off the coast of California, even though it seemed like the right thing to do, noting that: “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” As Diamond suggested in an interview on National Public Radio’s Fresh Air, “[t]he lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.”
In that same vein, the president has baselessly boosted the stock market while providing deceptive public health reassurances. “The Coronavirus,” he tweeted on 24 February, “is very much under control in the USA … Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”
Trump built on this idea last Friday. At a press conference where he finally declared Covid-19 a national emergency, Trump bizarrely passed the microphone to one corporate CEO after another – “celebrities in their own right”, he gushed, “… the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world”. After the conference, he sent a note to his supporters, obtained and reported by CNN, that trumpeted: “From opening of press conference, biggest day in stock market history!” It included a graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with his signature – as much a statement of his political priorities as historians are likely to uncover.
Sooner or later, however, Trump will realize that he cannot bullshit his way past biology. Viruses are immune to propaganda; Covid-19 will advance regardless of Trump’s avarice. From his push to grind up Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the rich in 2017, to his bungling stock-market-obsessed response to Covid-19 in 2020, Trump and company have elevated self-interest above life."

","For some, workplaces are hotspots. For the over-65s, it’s shops and restaurants. We urgently need to change our behaviour
Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.
Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for diseases like Sars, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness – it is easy to recognise people who are infected.
In the case of Covid-19, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why airport screening at arrival is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, containment has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.
So how does an epidemic spread through a population – and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as R), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.
The larger the value of R, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to 1.4 new infections. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the early stages of an outbreak. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.
In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce R below 1. For diseases such as measles, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on R. For R of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for R of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get R below 1.
However, an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.
Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.
Another option to reduce the duration of infection is continued testing; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).
If we can’t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds with hot water and soap, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick – all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.
Cancelling large gatherings, working from home and school closures are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.
But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called BBC Pandemic, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.
What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 – who are particularly at risk from severe Covid-19 illness – make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.
Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number R, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.
We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it. Starting now, and for the duration of this epidemic, we all have a role to play and a responsibility to modify our behaviour in order to protect the ones who are most at risk.

Italy will be Europe's canary in the coalmine for the post-Covid economy

","All eyes will be on the southern European state to see if the ECB’s measures will prevent a health emergency becoming an economic one
If there were any doubts as to how seriously European officials are treating the Covid-19 emergency, the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s reference to this being his country’s “darkest hour” should help dispel them. Italy is the European country currently most affected by the virus, with the highest number of cases and fatalities. It might be the first in the region to be badly hit, but it almost certainly won’t be the last.
Whether even more aggressive or creative action may be required in the coming weeks or months, no one knows. The initial reaction to the measures announced by the European Central Bank was mixed. But unlike the sovereign debt crisis – which first affected Greece and then Italy, Spain and Portugal – there is no political or economic divide between the needs of the core and the periphery of Europe in the face of the coronavirus challenge.
GDP declines for both Q1 and Q2 could prove to be twice as bad as anything seen during the 2008 financial crisis
While Italy’s expenditure on healthcare as a share of GDP is in line with most of its European neighbours, it stands apart from the rest of the euro area on its poor economic fundamentals. Italy’s GDP is only 5% higher than it was in 2000; in France it is 29%. Unemployment and government debt are also high relative to the rest of the euro area, while levels of government investment – a decade ago on par with the rest of the euro area and the UK – are now significantly lower.
Unsurprisingly, therefore, on a number of market-relevant variables the Italian banking system registers toward the weak end of the European spectrum: adversely hit by a high proportion of non-performing loans (7.2% against a European average of 2.9%, according to the European Banking Authority), little demand for new business and historically low interest rates and margins.
As Italy and much of the region probably now faces a technical recession, all eyes are on whether the fiscal and monetary measures being introduced will prevent a health emergency from becoming an economic emergency, with companies and households unable to pay their debts.
Precisely how bad the Italian and euro area economic data will turn out to be over the first half of this year is hard to estimate. But if Italian output declined by, say, 20% this month, flatlined next month, and then the economy started to bounce back over the course of May and June, GDP declines for both the first and second quarters will prove to be twice as bad as anything seen during even the lowest points of the 2008 financial crisis.
With other parts of Europe now seeing school closures, parents staying at home to look after their children, restaurants and other retailers shutting their doors and consumer spending on non-essential goods and services being put on hold, other countries will undoubtedly see a similar situation unfold. The only question is one of timing.
Another concern is that even if the immediate crisis ends up being contained over the coming months, the aftershocks could linger well beyond that, as the summer tourism season is wiped out and businesses lose a huge portion of their annual revenues. In southern Europe, that could mean the banks face another wave of loan defaults, national governments take in much lower than anticipated tax revenues, and the markets then question the sustainability of government finances and whether the weakest banks across Europe can get by without having to raise additional capital.
Faced with these risks, European policymakers are stepping up their response. Fiscal policy, as expected, is leading the way, with the governments looking at a variety of measures, including postponing tax collection, allowing households and businesses to delay mortgage and loan repayments, giving banks the regulatory leeway to allow customers to postpone debt interest payments, helping the self-employed with cash payments, and governments underwriting emergency loans to small and medium-sized enterprises.
Similarly, the ECB responded last week by expanding the size of its quantitative easing programme and by providing banks with the ability to borrow money at even lower rates. The hope is that these actions are transmitted into the real economy, lowering borrowing costs for governments, households and companies, and will lay the foundations for a stronger recovery once the worst of the epidemic is behind us and economies start to claw back whatever output will be lost over the coming months.
“Whatever it takes” was Mario Draghi’s powerful but highly controversial rallying cry in 2012, despised by many across the region who thought the ECB was overstepping its mark in keeping the euro area economies afloat. In the current crisis, however, every government and central bank is committed to this maxim – and Europe is stronger for it.

'Nothing less than a catastrophe': Venice left high and dry by coronavirus
",John Brunton,"As destinations around the world face unprecedented challenges, we ask local people working in tourism in Venice how they are coping

Few destinations in the world are as closely tied to tourism as Venice. Last year the city ramped up measures to deal with the impact of over-tourism, until the unprecedented acqua alta  flooding in November brought the Unesco-listed city to its knees. The financial repercussions of the flood reminded everyone that tourism of some kind is still vital to keep this unique city afloat. Then the coronavirus crisis arrived, initially cutting short the February Carnival, which traditionally kicks off the tourist season. Now, along with the rest of Italy, the entire city is in lockdown, with restaurants and bars shuttered, hotels closed, flights and international trains suspended. With no tourists left in town, what do Venetians whose livelihoods rely on tourism think the future holds for them?
Mario di Martino, a well-known promoter of contemporary art exhibitions, is anxious but quietly confident “With all museums and temporary exhibitions closed, my work has obviously disappeared completely, which is difficult financially, he said. “But I think the Biennale of Architecture has made a good decision to postpone its opening from May until August, hopefully to give some time for things to get back to normal before people begin to reconsider visiting Venice again. Planning art shows always begins months in advance anyway, and with the important heritage Venice has as an artistic and cultural city, I do not think we will be abandoned by people.”
For independent tour guide Stacy Gibboni, there are more immediate problems, like paying the rent on 1 April. “Venice for me was always the perfect city, a place where I can earn sufficient money to live as a tour guide, leaving me plenty of free time to follow my real passion of being a painter,” she said. “But now my work has disappeared, with no future bookings to take tourists round, especially with the travel ban, as I work a great deal with American visitors. For sure, tourists will return to Venice in the long term, but I cannot count on when that will happen, so I am having to look at other means of earning my livelihood.”
The future seems even more uncertain for Gloria Astolfo, who creates handmade jewellery using Murano glass. “I initially closed my workshop and boutique, both right by Piazza San Marco, for the health concerns of my employees, who come into work by bus from Mestre and were terrified about the coronavirus,” she recounted. “Because we are registered as artisans, there is a special fund that will pay most of their wages for three months but, frankly, I may well be out of business by then with all the bills and rent I have to pay. So I have told them to already start thinking about other employment. I am pretty sure this crisis will last a lot longer than people think, and that afterwards people will simply not want to travel again for a long time. And my business, like all of Venice, relies wholly on tourism, so it is nothing less than a catastrophe.”
The peak could be as late as mid-May here, and as other countries are being affected later, it makes the outlook worse
Those running restaurants and hotels are trying to remain positive. Raffaele Alajmo runs the historic and opulent Caffè Quadri on on Saint Mark’s Square, along with his brother Massimiliano, a Michelin-starred star chef. “If you ask me about the future, I can only say I have absolutely no idea,” he said. “I think here in Italy we are doing our best, following the sensible instructions of our government to stay home to try to contain the virus, while obviously sustaining serious financial losses. Together with our restaurants in Paris and Morocco, we employ 220 people, and we are determined not to lose any of them, but it is difficult to know what to think when each country is reacting differently to this crisis. I do believe, though, that as soon as travel restrictions are lifted – whenever that may be – travellers will quickly return to Venice.”
The Perkhofer family have been running their landmark Hotel Gabrielli for four generations, and Francesca Perkhofer was philosophical about current events. “We’d already decided to close our hotel for a year in December, after the acqua alta disaster, to reinvest and repair damage from the flooding. So all our clients know we will not reopen for some time,” she said. “Even though we have now had to suspend the renovations because of the coronavirus restrictions, I continue to have faith in the future of tourism in Venice. For companies operating in the tourism sector, the outlook is clearly very tough. We have government forms to fill in asking to postpone payments for rents, bank loans, refuse collection– to give everyone some time to breathe. But the season is lost, and we do not know how long it will last. The peak could be as late as mid-May for Italy, and the fact that other European countries like Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands are being affected later than us makes the outlook for tourism even worse.
“Even if we get investment loans, they have to be repaid,” said Perkhofer. “I am curious to see how the situation will improve after corona. It will take a while before trust in safe travelling returns. Will everybody rush to recover lost turnover at all costs? Or will we all think and learn– how we can improve the quality of worldwide tourism and cut down excessive travelling? For Venice, I am more than confident that we will get back to normal very soon. This unique city is so beautiful, so special, that tourists will come back quite soon, and we are already working on marketing programmes to protect the future for Venice.”
That will all be too late for Roberto Meneghetti, a retired osteria owner who supplements his income by renting out a holiday home to tourists. “With no tourists and no future bookings, I have simply closed up the apartment,” he said regretfully. “And once all this blows over, I will have to put it on the market to recoup my investment. But I am a Venetian and will never leave Venice, because despite all these problems, I could never live anywhere else.”"

Adrienne Matei","With millions of us lying low to limit the spread of Covid-19, how best to manage being cooped up for days on end?

By now, we all know that voluntary social distancing is key to mitigating the spread of Covid-19. In the grand scheme of things, lying low for a little while is a small sacrifice to make for the increased safety of all, though it certainly will pose challenges, not least of which being to our relationships.
“It will become easy to think of one another as a burden,” writes the Atlantic’s Helena Fitzgerald, “especially when we are cooped up together or when isolation breeds feelings of abandonment.” This raises the question: how can we best manage the unusual social circumstances we’re in?
In 2017, engineer Ansley Barnard spent eight months living in an isolated dome habitat with five other scientists as part of Nasa’s Hi-SEAS program, which was developed to simulate the experience of traveling to Mars. During that time, she learned several lessons applicable to anyone living with roommates.
“Talking about a potential conflict early on prevents things from getting worse,” says Barnard. “Our strategies in the habitat were to be open about our feelings and avoid blame. It can help to carve out private places in the same home so that you can decompress alone if you need to,” she says.
Barnard and her team ate dinner together every evening, using that time to set aside any issues and work on their relationships with each other. “I think having a positive attitude and looking at your situation as a temporary opportunity instead of a setback can help keep you moving forward,” she says.
According to Joshua David Stein, editor of the parenting publication Fatherly, if you’re practicing social distancing with your kids, now is the time to readjust your rule structure.
“Just like how when you take kids on a plane they can watch as much TV as they want – it’s kind of the same, at least for now,” he says. Fatherly has compiled a list of at-home activities for bored kids, the internet abounds with kid-friendly podcasts, museum tours and educational videos, and Stein notes that it’s a good time to get outside and take advantage of local parks, too.
If your kids are worried about grandparents they’re unable to visit during the pandemic, Stein suggests: “without lying, frame it in a way that will assuage their worries as much as possible. Like, ‘Grandma is doing fine, for her safety and our safety, we’re going to rely on FaceTime for now.’” It’s also to be expected that your patience will wear thin at times. “You’re going to freak out at your kids a little bit,” says Stein. “It’s not the best thing in the world but it’s not the end of the world, don’t beat yourself up about it, try to do better next time.”
“This is a situation where you kind of know what is going to happen so you have time to come up with a gameplan,” says Erin Davidson, a couples and sex therapist. “Chat about what to do in moments where things are stressful – normalize that it’s OK if you get on each other’s nerves, and decide on a signal that means ‘OK, we need to take a moment in separate rooms, or recognize better communication is needed, or perhaps someone needs a hug or to talk about emotions that are coming up.’”
Davidson says both partners should get comfortable asking for – and giving each other – space. While it may be a tricky time to date, low-risk, symptom-free partners living in relative isolation together can certainly use this time to have more sex. “There’s a website called MojoUpgrade.com and it’s fun because both of you fill out ‘yes-no-maybe’ questions about sexual things you want to try individually, and then it only emails you with the things you both matched up with a ‘yes’ on,” she says. “It’s a low-pressure fun thing you can do.”
For the last three years, writer and musician Kristal Jax has been making ironic, Barbie-heavy memes about coping with mental illness, trauma and social issues, which she posts to her Instagram account @Dyingbutfine. Several of Jax’s recent posts have centered on Covid-19, including a “quarantine bingo” meme and a multi-post filled with ideas for how to distract yourself while home alone, such as by crafting, cleaning or making your own memes. “I find humour is a way to connect and let off steam when you’re really upset or anxious – just have some kind of catharsis,” she says.
In addition to taking on domestic projects, Jax says reaching out to offer support to others, if you’re able, is a good way to feel less alone. “I find helping people during times of crisis really helps you control your own anxiety, because you’re like, ‘Oh, I have a purpose,’” she says. “If you don’t know someone well enough to know how they would feel about you checking in on them you could still send a message to them saying, ‘Hey, I’m checking in on friends right now, do you need anything?’” And if you’re completely cooped up, “know that you staying home is you doing something,” says Jax, “even if you feel powerless.”"

Forget your Zoflora-scented flat or the freshly bleached kitchen table that is now your office, or even the sealed-off hospital rooms accessible only by medical professionals in hazmat suits: the two safest places in the world to hide from the coronavirus are officially the German and Canadian Big Brother houses.
The German version of the show started on 6 February, and the contestants currently have no idea that the rest of the world is living through a pandemic because, as per the rules of the show, they are not allowed any contact with the outside world. When they went into the house, no cases of coronavirus had been confirmed outside China. And, incredibly, even though new people are entering the show all the time, they are not allowed to tell the current housemates anything.
What a secret to keep! Imagine: the contestants are trying to talk them into revealing the latest football score or find out who the viewer’s favourite housemates are, and, inside, these poor reality stars-to-be are probably screaming that people are dying, and won’t they please, please wash their hands more often? The housemates will find out about the coronavirus at 7pm tonight in a special episode, where they can ask Big Brother questions such as “Are my parents OK?” and get video messages from their family. It is due to be broadcast live because, well, why would you waste the TV gold that is contestants’ hysterical tears?
The Canadian Big Brother started on 6 March – so before mass gatherings were banned in the country – and the confused housemates can’t work out why they cannot hear the audience booing them during evictions. “Maybe the house is … suddenly soundproof?” offered one contestant in a clip that has gone viral on Twitter. Which sounds stupid, until you realise that randomly guessing: “Uh, maybe a global pandemic broke out and it’s unsafe to gather in crowds,” would be even weirder. It is understood they have finally been told since the clip was released.
Big Brother Brazil’s cast are also completely unaware of coronavirus – since they entered the house on 21 January, producers have refused to update them on the outside world.
It is not like the show hasn’t been preparing for this moment. In 2013, the UK Big Brother house had a fake “viral outbreak”, in which housemates had to decide which of them got the only six gas masks or go into quarantine. The task was inspired by Charlie Brooker’s 2008 horror series Dead Set, in which Big Brother’s production staff and contestants are trapped inside the house during a zombie apocalypse. Spoiler alert: it does not end well for Davina McCall.
Clearly, it is an ethical and moral nightmare withholding information from reality show participants. On the one hand, the ignorant bliss sounds incredible. Imagine waking up every day having slept, worry-free, through the night, and then having to constantly remind yourself the reason you have to take in every breath with a gasp is merely the tight pain of anxiety in your chest, not a superbug that has killed thousands of people. Unlike the rest of the population, you don’t have to live with the dual fears of running out of loo roll or accidentally infecting the people you love the most leading to their deaths. Lovely.
But then again: if UK Big Brother is anything to go by, the house will be a hotbed of unsanitary practices; career-ruining Jacuzzi sex, fumbles under the covers lit up by night vision cameras, and long snogs in the loo because that is the only place without cameras. Yes, it is clean now, but once the house is infected – remember those new contestants sworn to secrecy? – it’ll kick off quicker than a row over the washing up.
And by not telling them, isn’t it just saying that their safety is less of a priority than ratings? It’s not like the latest series of Love Island, where contestants were not told about former host Caroline Flack’s death until after they left the villa, which made for strangely disquieting viewing.
There is a fourth Big Brother house – who knew the show was still so popular? – where the cast had no idea about the coronavirus pandemic until yesterday, when producers on Big Brother Australia made the decision to tell the housemates about the “situation”. Personally, if a killer virus was sweeping the world, I would probably want to leave and speak to my family, just in case the worst happened, instead of riding it out on live TV, eyes firmly fixed on the cash prize and Instagram followers. That’s just me, though. I’m weird like that.
But, at time of going to press, nobody has walked out of the Australian Big Brother house. Is it worth ignoring the fact that your family are at risk from a global pandemic just to have access to a house full of toilet roll and pasta? Hard to say at this time – ask us again in three weeks’ time."

The American actor and songwriter Jared Leto has just learned about the coronavirus after being isolated in the desert for almost two weeks.
The Thirty Seconds to Mars frontman made the surprising revelation over Instagram after he emerged from a silent meditation for the past 12 days. That meant he had been living completely cut off the grid, void of news and governmental updates on the deadly coronavirus outbreak which has spread across the planet.
“Wow,” his post began.
The virus has infected nearly 200,000 worldwide and more than 5,000 people in the US.
“We were totally isolated,” the actor wrote in an Instagram post. “We had no idea what was happening outside the facility.”
Leto’s reintroduction to the outside world resulted in the shocking discovery that Americans had been self-quarantining, with officials telling citizens to limit their contact with other people. His group “walked out into a very different world. One that’s been changed forever,” he said.

Leto wouldn’t be the first public figure completely unaware of an impending global pandemic. Show producers of a German version of the hit TV series Big Brother have revealed the current season’s 14 contestants are currently unaware of an outbreak of the deadly coronavirus.
As messages of well wishes and some jokes poured in, Leto reminded his followers to “stay safe” by staying inside. “Hope you and yours are ok. Sending positive energy to all,” he wrote."

Luke Henriques-Gomes","Calls for suspension of demand that welfare recipients meet employment agencies


Mon 16 Mar 2020 06.36 GMT


Last modified on Tue 17 Mar 2020 04.57 GMT


A national organisation representing Australia’s welfare recipients has called on the government to suspend mutual obligations to prevent people having their payments suspended during the coronavirus crisis.
Under normal circumstances, people who receive payments such as Newstart must record their job searches online and attend meetings with employment services agencies to avoid having their income support cut off.
The government has said people forced into isolation according to the official health advice can access a 14-day personal crisis exemption before they require a medical certificate.
Yet there are fears that others who do not officially need to self-isolate but are unable to meet their obligations due to the unfolding pandemic may have their payments suspended.
Guardian Australia has spoken to a woman with a compromised immune system who was told she would still need to attend an appointment with an employment services provider despite her condition.
Jeremy Poxon, an Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union spokesman, said the organisation had written to the government to ask that it suspend mutual obligations for jobseekers across the country.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

Poxon said it would be impossible for some people to meet obligations – such as recording their job searches online – in areas where public libraries and other facilities were being closed.
“If they don’t suspend mutual obligations, people will be penalised and cut off in the middle of this crisis,” he said.
Research shows that Newstart recipients are more likely to suffer from poor health, while government data shows about 40% of people on Newstart have a partial capacity to work, meaning Centrelink acknowledges that they cannot work full-time due to an illness or disability.
Among them is Vanessa, a Newstart recipient who said she was told by her disability employment agency on Friday that she would still need to attend an appointment.
Vanessa, who did not want her surname used, said she had undergone chemotherapy over a significant period of time and was now required to take an immunosuppressant for the rest of her life.
She is avoiding leaving the house to keep herself safe but would need to take a tram to get to the job services provider. “My appointment is next Wednesday and I have to go,” she said. “If I don’t go, I don’t get money.”
Current government advice states that only those who are exhibiting symptoms, those who have returned from overseas, and people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case must self-isolate.
In a fact sheet published on Monday afternoon, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment said people were required to keep attending appointments unless they needed to self-isolate in line with the official advice from the health department.
Asked if the government was considering suspending mutual obligations, a department spokeswoman said employment service providers were being “encouraged to be responsive and [flexible] during this challenging time”.
She said it was “recommended” providers use the “online portal and phone to negotiate alternative job-seeking activities where appropriate with jobseekers”.
The spokeswoman said jobseekers with concerns should contact their provider or the National Customer Service Line.
“The Department will continue to monitor this situation closely and will review this advice as needed, in line with direction from the Department of Health,” she said.
Vanessa believed the current arrangements precluded her from getting an exemption. Her provider is aware of her health issues and concerns but was told her appointment was going ahead.
“I don’t have the virus, nor have I come into contact with someone who has,” she said. “I am, however, in a category of being more susceptible by being immuno-compromised. It is my understanding that I don’t fit the current rules for not attending the appointment.”
The Government needs to confirm what is going on with mutual obligations. I am very worried about people falling through the cracks and not getting their payments during this time.#Auspol #Centrelink #COVIDー19 https://t.co/CSVt981pzQ
Also on Monday, Centrelink said it had fixed an technical glitch that told welfare recipients their next payment would be cut in half.
Messages sent to Guardian Australia show payments due after 20 March, when the government will create the new jobseeker payment, were set at about half the normal rate.
Alice Eldridge, who receives Newstart, told Guardian Australia that the glitch was “extremely distressing” and had made the coronavirus crisis even “scarier” for people surviving on low incomes.
“I spent all of yesterday in a downward spiral because I was panicking about how I could pay my rent, bills, food or medications in the next two weeks, and wondering if I’ll be out on the street with the rest of the homeless population that are being forgotten during this pandemic,” she said.
In a statement on Twitter, Centrelink said at midday on Monday: “We’re aware some people’s future payments weren’t displaying correctly over the weekend. This has since been fixed. We apologise for any confusion or concern this caused.”
It came as the government pushes ahead with an overhaul to payments such as Newstart, youth allowance and sickness allowance, which from 20 March will be rolled into the jobseeker payment. The government has stressed that the eligibility requirements will remain the same and no one will receive a lower payment due to the administrative change.
The Greens senator Rachel Siewert has called on the government to postpone the change, citing confusion during the coronavirus crisis.
Hank Jongen, a Services Australia spokesman, said the issue was due to a “routine update separate to jobseeker payment and we fixed this in a matter of hours”.
“It won’t affect the introduction of jobseeker payment,” he said."

Aboriginal people who work for the dole will have to show up for group activities as usual, despite the government telling service providers that there is a “high likelihood that larger scale community outbreaks [of Covid-19] will occur in the near future”.
The National Indigenous Australians agency (NIAA) wrote to CDP (community development program) providers on Monday to tell them “mutual obligations remain in place at this stage”, meaning that Aboriginal people will still be expected to turn up for work or risk losing their welfare payments.
“Any changes for particular areas affected by coronavirus or other extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis in line with existing procedures,” the NIAA CEO, Ray Griggs, wrote in a letter obtained by Guardian Australia.
The letter said any CDP participant who is unwell and may have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 should call Centrelink to discuss obtaining a “major personal crisis exemption”, valid for 14 days, to “avoid any suspension of payment”.
“We are aware that some participants have expressed concerns about attending appointments or undertaking group-based activities. At this stage, the advice is that activities should continue as usual,” Griggs wrote, adding that CDP providers could “negotiate alternative activities”.
“If a site closure is warranted, the NIAA will deploy a streamlined approach to ensure this can be actioned quickly,” he wrote.
Labor is calling on the government to make sure that activity and mutual obligation requirements are suspended if necessary.
“People should not be put in harm’s way unnecessarily and proper risk assessments need to be done, particularly for remote communities in the CDP program,” Labor’s Indigenous Australians spokesperson, Linda Burney, said.
“There needs to be urgent communication with people about rules and exemptions – so people aren’t worried about what they need to do to get paid, and they can follow health advice where required,” she said.
But the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said “CDP activities play an important role in community life” and mutual obligation would stay in place for the time being.
“If a CDP participant is unable to meet their mutual obligation requirements because of illness they should call Centrelink who will provide a major personal crisis exemption from mutual obligation for 14 days,” a spokesman for the minister said.
“Any changes for particular areas affected by coronavirus or other extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case by case basis.
“This applies to all Australians who have mutual obligation requirements.”
The decision is in line with advice published by the Department of Health, the minister’s office said.
On Monday, Australia’s peak Aboriginal health group, representing hundreds of community-controlled health care services, called for state and territory governments to urgently protect Aboriginal people in remote areas, who are highly vulnerable to Covid-19.
The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho) said governments should consider deploying the army in remote areas, where health workers face major challenges in containing any outbreak, including a lack of access to equipment, testing and urgent emergency care.
“Everybody has to step up, that’s how serious this is,” the Naccho CEO, Pat Turner, said.
“State and territory governments need to do everything they can to stop this getting into our communities.
“If this gets into any remote community, there will be a high rate of deaths. Our communities will be devastated, because of the already low levels of health,” Turner said."

One of the world’s biggest suppliers of coronavirus tests is about to rush new equipment onto the Australian market that can deliver results within three hours.
Australia, like many nations across the globe, is facing some pressure on its ability to test for coronavirus due to what health authorities say is “unprecedented” demand on laboratories.
Roche, a multinational medical device company, says it has rushed to develop a new test to support “the urgent need for patient testing during the novel coronavirus pandemic”.
Roche says results can be returned within three hours of testing. That allows for 384 tests in an eight-hour shift.
The process, known as the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, was rushed onto the market using emergency authorisations provided by medical device regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration and Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration.
The new testing kits are expected to begin arriving in Australia by Wednesday. Together with an older test already in use, known as the MagNA Pure 96, Roche says this will inject 100,000 new testing kits into Australian laboratories.
“The demand for Covid-19 tests in Australia is unprecedented and our teams have been working relentlessly to meet demands,” the company said on Monday.
“Roche will be reordering both test kits frequently, based on Australian patient needs. We will continue to have both tests available in Australia, to ensure maximum coverage and patient reach.
“We are continuing to work with Australian laboratories and the federal government to ensure locations of greatest need are prioritised and people at the highest risk of Covid-19 have access to these tests.”
The Australian Medical Association on Monday warned that variable supply of a standard reagent was contributing to pressures on testing capacity in some states and territories. The reagent, a chemical substance used to extract nucleic acid from samples, is critical to the testing process.
A lack of reagent has also contributed to the poor testing capacity in the United States, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it is working across the clock to resolve the issue.
Last week, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said supply issues affecting testing were “temporary” and were being urgently addressed.
“It’s a temporary issue, but it relates to the fact that a number of countries where these consumables are made have probably put export controls over them to keep them for their own use,” he said. “We will work through it. We’ve got world-leading medical technology and will fix that issue, but it has caused a temporary issue with the scale of the testing that we can do at the moment.”
On Monday, the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the issue was not with testing kits, but with “consumables”. Kelly also said it was temporary and would be addressed with urgency.
Roche said in its statement it has been working day and night to boost supply of testing kits.
“Globally, we are going to the limits of our production capacity to make sure large quantities of tests are available for countries most in need,” the statement said.
“Appropriate testing is absolutely key during this uncertain time.”"

More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists are trapped on board a cruise ship that is currently stuck off the coast of Chile after the country banned cruise ships from docking in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Roald Amundsen, owned by cruise company Hurtigruten, is one of several stranded off the Chilean port of Punta Arenas, and has a capacity of less than 500 passengers.
Chile has banned cruise vessels from docking until September after an elderly passenger on one cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus.
The country’s health minister, Jaime Mañalich announced the ban on Twitter on Sunday.
Hemos decidido prohibir la recalada en todo puerto chileno de cruceros a partir de las 8:00 de mañana domingo. Se implementará por DIRECTMAR. https://t.co/pxDkVjmHYf
Guardian Australian has confirmed more than 100 doctors, dentists and medical experts from Australia were on board for a 10-night cruise to Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and the Chilean Fjords as part of a combined medical and dental conference put on by Unconventional Conventions.
Speakers at the event include Prof Gordian Fulde AO, Dr Glenn Rice-McDonald and associate professor Peter S Hamblin, according to the guide for the conference. The convention host is an accredited education provider with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.
The cruise departed on 29 February, and was due to return on Tuesday, docking at the port the ship is currently blocked from docking.
The ship’s live cam shows the vessel sitting stationary off the coast.
The cruise company, Hurtigruten said it was working with the Chilean government, local authorities, embassies, airports and airlines to arrange disembarkation as soon as possible.
“Our passengers and crew are our top priority and all are well. Our task force’s focus is to get all passengers home as quickly and safely as possible and we are regularly updating our passengers on board with our plans to get them home,” says Damian Perry, managing director of Hurtigruten Asia Pacific.
The company said guests were in good spirits and there have been no cases of coronavirus on board.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was aware of the situation and was ready to provide consular assistance.
Guardian Australia has sought comment from the conference organisers.
A Sacramento lawyer, Bill Portanova, on the ship with his wife told the Sacramento Bee that the captain had been trying to negotiate to land somewhere for days.
“We’re offshore and, apparently, the story we got is that they worked something out where we would be taken to the port, health-screened, removed from the ship with masks and gloves directly into buses and straight to the airport,” Portanova said.
“But some locals got wind of the plan and there was some kind of a protest, so the deal fell through.”
The ship launched last year, and has three restaurants, a gym and wellness centre, an infinity pool and hot tubs.
Celebrity Eclipse, a ship with a capacity of close to 3,000, has also been refused docking in Chile since the ban, BuzzFeed News reported.
Chile had reported 155 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Monday, when president Sebastián Piñera announced Chile would close its borders to foreigners from Wednesday.
Other countries to ban cruise ships docking include Australia, Colombia, Greece, Italy, Montanegro and Portugal.
Several cruise companies have decided to suspend cruises for the near future."

Australia’s peak Aboriginal health group, representing hundreds of health care services, wants state and territory governments to make urgent arrangements to protect Aboriginal people in remote areas who are highly vulnerable to Covid-19.
The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho) said governments should consider deploying the army in remote areas, where health workers face major challenges in containing any outbreak, including a lack of access to equipment, testing and urgent emergency care.
“Everybody has to step up, that’s how serious this is,” the Naccho CEO, Pat Turner, said.
“State and territory governments need to do everything they can to stop this getting into our communities. If this gets into any remote community, there will be a high rate of deaths. Our communities will be devastated, because of the already low levels of health.
“The army is our friend in this situation. They have the necessary resources, and we should be briefing army health co-ordinators and have them on standby to be deployed [to places that] we have difficulty reaching, helping us manage this pandemic,” Turner said.
Remote-area health workers urgently need more personal protective equipment, she said, after receiving reports that clinics in the Kimberley region of Western Australia had received only two sets each of masks, gloves and gowns for healthcare staff to use.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”

 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

Turner said the equipment is essential for remote workers because timely testing is not available and they are relying on clinical diagnosis of Covid-19.
“It can take up to two weeks for tests to be returned, and in that time, if someone has it, the whole community will get it,” Turner said.
Local and state governments must prepare isolation and quarantine centres, she said, because “self-isolation is just unrealistic where there’s overcrowding in housing because of decades and decades of government neglect.
“Local and state governments need to be working with local communities to identify structures that can be adapted for isolation, and they need two kinds: one for suspected cases, and the other for people who are known to have it.”
Naccho is providing a briefing for the Aboriginal taskforce on Covid-19, which will report to the national cabinet tomorrow.
“The national cabinet meeting tomorrow should realise the seriousness of this for Aboriginal Australia and make sure the necessary resources are provided immediately,” Turner said.
“We need information urgently on what to do in every situation. Our health services need to know.”
Naccho represents 143 Aboriginal community-controlled health services across the country.
On the weekend, the Northern Land Council (NLC) suspended all existing non-essential permits to visit Aboriginal lands, and said it won’t grant any new ones until further notice.
“The NLC has received many calls from community members asking that we do all we can to ensure the safety and protection of Aboriginal people,” the CEO, Marion Scrymgour, said.
“This decision will not affect the permits issued to doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers, council workers and others that provide essential services for Aboriginal people out bush,” she said.
The NLC and Naccho have both called on the federal government to consider the concerns of the traditional Aboriginal owners of Kakadu national park, who say it should close immediately. Parks Australia has been contacted for comment.
On the Tiwi Islands, the weekend’s AFL grand final and art fair, which usually draw thousands of visitors, were closed to outsiders.
The Northern Territory government said it is implementing current national advice for self-isolation of 14 days for all international arrivals and a ban on cruise ships for 30 days. Government schools across the Northern Territory will remain open.
It has produced health announcements in nine Aboriginal languages, including Warlpiri and Yolngumatha, and set up a hotline for territory residents: 1800 008 002.
There is one confirmed case of Covid-19 in the Northern Territory: a tourist who is currently in Royal Darwin hospital."

European stock markets have suffered fresh losses after an early rally fizzled amid a mounting corporate and economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic.
Hopes for the UK chancellor’s business support package had driven the FTSE 100 index in London 2% higher in early trading, before renewed fears about the rapid spread of the virus pushed it more than 40 points lower to 5,100, a fall of 0.8%.
Among the biggest losers on the blue chip index were the catering company Compass, which issued a profit warning after being forced to close nearly half its business, holiday firm Tui and the cruise firm Carnival.
As EU leaders discussed how to combat the crisis in a day-long conference call, Germany’s Dax lost 0.6% and France’s CAC fell 0.64%. Italy’s FTSE MiB see-sawed and is currently trading 1.2% higher, while Spain’s Ibex hung on to gains of 2.9%. In Asia, stock markets had bounced back overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei closing up 5.8% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 0.87% higher.
Wall Street got off to a positive start, with the Dow Jones up 2.1% and the S&P 500 gaining 2.5%. Like London, however, the rally swiftly fizzled out and shares turned negative. The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, while the Dow slipped 0.1% and the Nasdaq lost 0.5%.
Investors rushed to buy the dollar, considered a safe-haven investment, and sterling fell by 1.5% against the US currency at one stage, to $1.2085.
As the virus swept through Europe, Italy was the first country to go into national lockdown last week, and has now been followed by France, Spain, Austria and Germany. In the UK, the prime minister Boris Johnson has urged the public to work from home and to stay away from pubs, clubs and restaurants.
At 4pm GMT on Tuesday, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, along with the prime minister, is expected to unveil a rescue package for businesses threatened with collapse. Most companies in Britain do not have insurance cover for closures caused by infectious diseases, according to the industry body, the Association of British Insurers.
The rout on stock markets has prompted authorities in France, Italy, Spain and Belgium to ban short-selling on a number of stocks to shield some of Europe’s biggest companies from the sell-off. Short-selling means traders borrow company stock with a view to selling it and buying it back later at a lower price, and then pocket the difference. The practice tends to exacerbate panic selling.
The European Union’s market watchdog is stepping up surveillance of hedge funds and other short-sellers that may be taking advantage of the heavy selling in recent days. The European Securities and Markets Authorities has announced temporary measures that will force investors to hand over more information about their short-selling positions by cutting the threshold for disclosure in half."

Iranian police have dispersed crowds who forced their way into two popular shrines soon after they were closed because of the threat from the coronavirus outbreak.
Shia Muslims entered the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom on Monday night, protesting at the closures announced earlier in the day on Iranian state television.
The shrines are normally open for prayers around the clock. Health officials had told pilgrims that kissing and touching the shrines could spread the virus, and had urged clergy to close them for weeks.
Worshippers who entered the shrines chanted objections to the closures. In a statement, religious leaders and a prominent Qom seminary urged pilgrims to rely on wisdom and patience during the crisis.
The incident comes as religious authorities all over the world take steps to limit contact or close places of worship in response to the pandemic.
The virus has erupted as the world’s most popular religions prepare for important festivals during which large numbers of people usually gather to pray and celebrate. Easter and Passover take place next month, and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan – during which most of the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims will fast – begins around 23 April.
At the Vatican, the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the global 1.2 billion Roman Catholic population, Holy Week celebrations and services will take place without the physical presence of worshippers. Instead, they will be livestreamed, and broadcast on radio and television.
The square in front of St Peter’s Basilica is closed in compliance with the Italian government’s ban on gatherings. The pope’s daily 7am mass, the Angelus on Sundays, and his weekly general audience are being livestreamed and broadcast “so as to reach the faithful all over the world,” the Vatican said.
However, on Sunday Italian police dispersed people attending a mass at the church of St Francis of Assisi in Cerveteri, 27 miles north-west of Rome.
Fifteen people attended the service, which was being livestreamed on Facebook. Some sat outside the church’s open doors. Police entered the church after holy communion and before the final prayers of the mass.
Although some churches in Italy are open for private prayer and confession, the Italian government has ordered people to stay at home except to buy food or seek medical attention. Weddings, baptisms and funerals have been banned.
Pope Francis has urged priests to “have the courage to go out and visit the sick” and help with volunteering efforts – but many priests are over the age of 60 and therefore at greater risk from the virus.
In Malaysia, about two-thirds of the country’s 673 confirmed infections have been linked to an Islamic conference attended by about 16,000 people late last month at a mosque near the capital, Kuala Lumpur. In Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, the top Muslim body issued a fatwa stating that people should not attend Friday prayers if they live in an area which has a “high or very high transmission potential” but that people in areas with “low potential for transmission” must attend.
Across Europe and the US, churches, mosques, synagogues and temples have suspended public celebration of the liturgy either at their own initiative or because the authorities have banned gatherings or religious services. Many are livestreaming services and setting up WhatsApp groups of worshippers.
The Muslim Council of Britain urged mosques in the UK to suspend all congregational activity, including Friday prayers. It said: “The obligation for Friday prayers is very important to Muslims up and down the country. Given the overwhelming majority of Muslims identify with their local mosque, its centrality to communal activities should not be understated. The choice therefore to suspend all congregational activities, is not one that has been taken lightly.”
It consulted Islamic scholars who advised that the obligation to perform Friday prayers in mosque congregations be temporarily lifted.
Harun Khan, the MCB’s secretary general, said: “Whether it be at the mosques (particularly Friday prayers) which draw crowds including the elderly, vulnerable and those at high risk, weddings, social events or simple day-to-day activities, it is imperative that this extraordinary step is taken to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our communities, and our country as a whole.”"

The Church of England has suspended all services until further notice, saying it must become “a different sort of church in these coming months”.
However, weddings and funerals may still go ahead, a spokesperson said. The Methodist church also suspended services from Tuesday.
In a joint letter to parishes, the archbishops of Canterbury and York said the coronavirus pandemic was a defining moment for the C of E. They said: “Are we truly a church for all, or just the church for ourselves?”
The church must now be “rooted in prayer and serving others”, Justin Welby and John Sentamu said.
The letter said, where practical, churches could remain open as places of prayer for the community, but social-distancing recommendations must be observed. If possible, services should be conducted by clergy and live-streamed.
The archbishops said congregations should still be at the forefront of providing practical care and support for the poor and vulnerable during the crisis.
They wrote: “Our life is going to be less characterised by attendance at church on Sunday, and more characterised by the prayer and service we offer each day … Please do carry on supporting the local food bank and buy extra provisions for it. 
“Ensure the night shelters wherever possible are kept open. There are many very encouraging schemes happening right across our country in communities to focus on caring for the most vulnerable and do continue to play your part in those.”
The Church of Scotland cancelled its 2020 general assembly, which was scheduled to take place in Edinburgh in May. Almost 1,000 people were expected at the event, and the Duke of Cambridge was to attend as the Queen’s representative. 
A spokesperson said the church was considering whether to suspend services, with an announcement expected shortly.
Quakers have decided to continue to meet for worship until advised not to but will refrain from physical contact.
Paul Parker of Quakers in Britain said: “Quakers usually shake hands at the end of their meetings for worship, as an expression of unity. But the act of shaking hands itself is not a core part of Quaker faith and there are many other ways Quakers can share this greeting.”
He said many meetings were experimenting with online silent worship: “In extraordinary circumstances, we’ll do our best to become a virtual worshipping community.”
The Methodist church said services would be suspended, baptisms would not take place in public worship, and those planning weddings should consult their minister. 
“While funerals may still take place, we would advise that the number of people attending is limited as per the government’s advice,” it said in guidance issued on Tuesday.
The Catholic church in England and Wales has not suspended services but has introduced a series of measures to reduce infection including: advising against physical contact between priests and members of the congregation when giving communion; suspending the sign of the peace; removing holy water stoups; banning veneration of relics and the cross on Good Friday by kissing or physically touching them; no longer sharing hymn books and missals; and advising elderly and vulnerable parishioners to stay away from large parish gatherings.
After consulting Islamic scholars, the Muslim Council of Britain has advised mosques in the UK to suspend all congregational activity, including Friday prayers.
It said: “The obligation for Friday prayers is very important to Muslims up and down the country. Given the overwhelming majority of Muslims identify with their local mosque, its centrality to communal activities should not be understated. The choice therefore to suspend all congregational activities, is not one that has been taken lightly.”
Some gurdwaras have cancelled Nagar Kirtans, the Sikh religious processions that are a key part of Vaisakhi celebrations next month, and usually attract thousands.
Most synagogues in the UK have not suspended services but are following guidance about physical contact and hygiene.
Rabbi Jonathan Romain of Maidenhead synagogue said: “It is a really tough call. My heart tells me to keep services going for those who wish to attend and for whom both the religious and social experience is very important. My head tells me to cancel services in those people’s own health interest and to think of what is best for them medically, even if they do not. Sadly, I know my head will win over.”"

We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. That’s the main purpose of this press conference this afternoon ...
Yes this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable – and we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given we know that we will beat it.
And however tough the months ahead we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight.
And, to repeat, this government will do whatever it takes.
That’s all from this blog for tonight.

Sunak unveils massive assistance package for business hit by the virus. Dwarfing budget measures.
From my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty
The loans and grants for business also big -- but nothing further on sick pay or on benefits.Six days ago, Sunak unveiled a corona-budget with statutory sick pay at its heart. The pandemic's impact has grown since then - businesses are closing. what measures for those laid off?
I'm sorry to write this, but just as in its tackling of the pandemic itself the UK's economic response lags far behind our European neighbours. Johnson talked about this being 'wartime', so why are we wielding a peashooter?

And this is from Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary.
The Chancellor is right to provide emergency support for business. But this can’t be just a bailout for boardrooms. It has to put money in workers’ pockets too. Unions stand ready to work with govt to tackle this crisis. As always our priority is protecting jobs and livelihoods.

Labour says the Rishi Sunak package of measures does not do enough to protect workers. In a statement John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said:
People are being laid off today and losing their incomes. We are disappointed that this package does not address their concerns.
The further announcements laid out by the chancellor lack the certainty required amidst growing public anxiety and still do not go far enough in protecting workers, renters and those who are losing their jobs, or in fully supporting businesses at the scale necessary.
In particular, the chancellor’s claim that new forms of employment support will be developed does not appreciate the urgency and gravity of the situation. Workers and businesses need to know now that they will be supported, not in a few days’ time.


6.10pm GMT

Here are the details of the coronavirus rescue package for businesses announced by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor.
There is plenty here to appeal to people who run businesses. But Sunak had very little to say about measures that will directly help employees. (Workers, of course, benefit if their employers do not go bust, but there are millions of people who face losing pay because they are off sick, or because their hours have been reduced, or who work in the gig economy, who will be looking for more immediate support.) Sunak insisted that an employment support package was on its way, and that he needed to finalise the details first with business and the unions, but the balance of today’s announcement may fuel suspicions that the concerns of owners and managers are taking precedence over the concerns of those on the payroll.
1/ We will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses, we will help you protect your loved ones. We will do whatever it takes.Today, I am making available an initial £330bn of guarantees – equivalent to 15% of our GDP. Measures include:
2/ Any business who needs access to cash will be able to access a government-backed loan, on attractive terms.If demand is greater than the initial £330bn I’m making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required.
3/ To support lending to small and medium sized businesses, I am extending the new Business Interruption Loan Scheme I announced at the Budget last week, so that rather than loans of £1.2m, it will now provide loans of up to £5m, with no interest due for the first six months.
4/ I announced last week that for businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, with a rateable value of less than £51,000, they will pay no business rates this year. Today, I provided those businesses with an additional cash grant of up to £25,000 per business.
5/ I am also extending the business rates holiday to all businesses in those sectors, irrespective of rateable value.
6/ That means every single business in the retail, hospitality or leisure sector will pay no business rates whatsoever for 12 months, and if they have a rateable value of less than £51,000, they can now get a cash grant as well.
7/ I also announced last week that we would be providing £3,000 grants to the 700,000 of our smallest businesses. To support their cash flow, today I can increase those grants to £10,000.
8/ Following discussions with industry, I can announce today that for those in difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three month mortgage holiday – so that people will not have to pay a penny towards their mortgage while they get back on their feet.
9/ In the coming days, I will go much further to support people’s financial security. In particular, I will work with trade unions and businesses to urgently develop new forms of employment support to help protect people’s jobs and incomes through this period.
10/ The measures I have announced today are part of a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent response to what is a serious and evolving economic situation. These are only the first steps – I will set out the next stage of our response in the coming days.

Johnson is winding up now.
He says the more thoroughly people can follow the advice they have been given, the more they will be able to save lives and protect the NHS, and the more quickly they will get through this.
And that’s it. The press conference is over.
I will be posting a summary and reaction shortly.


5.48pm GMT
17:48


Q: Will you level with people about how bad this will be for the economy? Is a recession inevitable?
Sunak says this will have a significant impact on the economy.
But it will be temporary, he says.
Q: If you close schools, what will you do to help people reliant on free school meals?
Johnson says, as the government comes to this decision, it will have a plan to address this. They want to ensure parents and children get the help they need.
(It sounds from this very much as if it is more a matter of when, not if, schools are closed.)

5.45pm GMT

Q: People are confused what the rules are about staying at home. Can you explain?
Johnson says people are being told to avoid all unnecessary contact where they might get the disease, and to avoid groups, large and small.
Q: You made a joke about a “last gasp” attempt to get ventilators. Is that appropriate?
Johnson says he was referring to the fact that manufacturers only have a few weeks to build more manufacturers.
This question refers to a joke revealed in the London Playbook briefing. Here is the story, which describes the PM’s conference call with manufacturers yesterday.
Some participants came away from the conference call less than impressed with Johnson’s own performance. “He couldn’t help but act the clown, even though he was a on call with serious CEOs from goodness knows how many companies,” one participant told my POLITICO colleague Charlie Cooper. This individual said the PM “joked” that the enterprise to build more life-saving ventilators could be known as “Operation Last Gasp.” Ugh.

Q: What will you do to ensure this £330bn is allocated properly?
Sunak says he is confident this can be delivered properly. There will be a retail compaign, so they hear about the coronavirus business interruption loan.
Q: What will you do about shops? People are still panic buying.
There is no need for that, Johnson says.

5.39pm GMT

Q: What inputs to the model changed that led you to change strategy?
Vallance says the aim is to save the maximum number of lives. He says the proportion of people who make require ventilation looks higher.
But it was not so much the model that changed as the place the UK was judged to be in the epidemic. 
Q: What sort of employment support are you looking at? Will the state pay wages?
Sunak says he wants to find a way of helping businesses meet the fixed cost of paying their staff without having to let them go. There are international models available. But he wants something that will work quickly.


5.35pm GMT
17:35


Q: People are being laid off today. Would you urge firms to look at these measures first?
Sunak says he hopes this announcement will tell business that help is on its way. He does not want them to lay people off.
Q: People are confused by the advice about schools. You tell people not to mix, but you tell them to take their kids to schools where they will mix. When will you close schools?
Johnson says the position with schools is “under continuous review”.


5.33pm GMT
17:33


Q: Many firms facing falling demand. Why is your help in the form of lending when these firms have no way of knowing what the future holds. They may not want to take on more debt? And why not announce today what you will do to ensure people are not penalised for staying away from work?
Johnson says this is an extraordinary package of measures.
One day the economy will bounce back, he says.
Sunak says businesses have fixed costs, on rent and staff. For rent, the government is making cash grants available. 
On employees, Sunak says there have been improvements to SSP (statutory sick pay) and ESA (employment and support allowance).
But he wants to develop a bold and ambitious employment support package, he says.
There are options for this. He is working urgently on them with business and the unions.


5.29pm GMT
17:29


Q: The Imperial College paper yesterday said these measures could be in place for 18 months, while we look for a vaccine. Is that right?
Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, says Imperial College have been working with the government all along. He says the suppression techniques need to be done in such a way that they can be released at some point. But he says no one in the world yet knows how to do this.
He says vaccines are the answer. It used to take 20 years to develop one. Now work on one is starting already. But he says he does not think it will be ready within a year.
Q: You are offering loans. How will people pay them back?
Sunak says the loans are just one aspect of the policy.
He says fiscal policy and monetary policy both play a part. There has been a significant monetary policy response already.
He says this is a very comprehensive and sizeable package of direct fiscal support for businesses, in addition to the loans.
And he says he plans to go further in terms of employment support. He will work with businesses and unions on this.
Q: Do you take responsibility for the advice? And will you take responsibility for your dad?
Johnson says of course he takes responsibility. The more people follow the advice, the more people will be saved."

The coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019 in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people and the capital of Hubei province in China.
Over 80,000 cases have been reported in mainland China, but the number of cases outside of the country now exceeds that figure, with more than 170,000 affected worldwide. There have been in excess of 6,700 deaths so far.
The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.

There is no ideal time for a pandemic, but fewer countries are less equipped to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak than crisis-ridden Venezuela, warn doctors and public health experts.
Bed shortages, a lack of isolation areas and short supplies of soap are already a daily reality at one hospital in Ciudad Guayana, a city in the country’s east. There is a nearby centre set up for the pandemic response but workers there say there are not enough ambulances to ferry patients.
“We are experts in crisis,” one health worker said. “But the coronavirus is a whole other challenge and we’ll need much more support.”
Cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, reached 33 in Venezuela on Monday evening, following the first two confirmed cases three days earlier. The government responded with a quarantine in the capital, Caracas, and six other states, alongside travel bans. On Monday the regulation was extended to the whole country.
But the outbreak could hardly come at a worse time for Venezuela, which despite boasting the planet’s largest proven oil reserves remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant – Venezuela’s central bank said inflation reached nearly 10,000% last year – while shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies are routine.
Hospitals regularly face power outages, while basic supplies – from latex gloves to basic antibiotics – are often hard to come by. Four and a half million people have fled Venezuela, with healthcare workers and disease specialists among them. Treatable diseases such as diphtheria, measles and malaria continue to spread in fertile conditions.
“The health system is completely weakened and without the capability or resources to respond to people’s basic needs – let alone an epidemiological situation like Covid-19,” said José Félix Oletta, who served as Venezuela’s health minister from 1997 to 1999.
A survey of doctors across the country carried out by the local NGO Médicos Unidos found that only 25% of respondents had reliable running water in their hospitals and clinics. Two-thirds said they did not have gloves, masks, soap, goggles or scrubs.
At the University Hospital of Caracas 80% of health workers are without protective equipment to treat patients who could be contagious. “The stretcher bearer should wear a face mask, a disposable gown and gloves; the orderly who collects the waste must wear glasses and gloves – but none of that exists at the moment,” said Mauro Zambrano, a representative of the Union of Hospital and Clinic Workers.
On Monday workers in at least two hospitals in Caracas were resorting to making their own masks from items that had been donated. “We are looking for solutions,” Zambrano said. Hospitals across the country have started online campaigns to bring in supplies.
Few know for certain how broken the health system is, owing to the opacity of the administration of the embattled president, Nicolás Maduro. The most recent epidemiological survey carried out by his health ministry was published in 2016.
“When forces close to Maduro censor information, it is difficult to tell people what they need to know – it’s difficult to respond,” said José Manuel Olivares, an opposition politician and doctor. “Actions taken by Maduro to hurt the health system have made it a sad fact that the coronavirus pandemic will cause more deaths in Venezuela and the region.”
Maduro, the leftwing successor to Hugo Chávez, is resisting a challenge to his legitimacy from Juan Guaidó, an opposition leader backed by the US and 50 other countries. The incumbent retains the key support of the military and remains allied with Russia, China and Cuba. It is unclear how the international community will respond to the outbreak in Venezuela, or which leader it would be prepared to work with.
Maduro, announcing flight bans in response to the pandemic, said US sanctions were hurting his administration’s ability to buy medicines and foodstuffs.
Feliciano Reyna, who runs an NGO in Caracas that distributes medications to those who cannot get them otherwise, predicts that the isolation measures announced by the Maduro government will also be hampered by the crisis. “When trash isn’t collected, or there is no water to wash your hands, isolation at home can become unsanitary,” Reyna said. “We are not at all well prepared.”"

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Australia has introduced mandatory 14-day self-isolation for people arriving from overseas. But how will this be enforced?
Under the NSW Public Health Act, anyone who enters Australia from another country will be subject to a 14-day self-isolation quarantine, with fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ prison if they do not comply.
“Obviously the NSW government – indeed all governments around the country – are not wanting to impose penalties on people,” health minister Brad Hazzard said. “What we’re looking for is cooperation.”
The order banning mass gatherings of more than 500 people to stem the spread of coronavirus has also been made under the Public Health Act, with fines of up to $55,000 for corporations who breach that ban and $27,500 for each additional day the event continues.
The order explicitly excludes gatherings including the ordinary operation of a school, university, Tafe and educational college; the ordinary conduct of a court; public transport; and employees attending a workplace. It will remain in place until 14 June.
The Victorian government enacted a four-week state of emergency under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008, extending from 12pm Monday to midnight 13 April unless extended.
The state of emergency declaration gives authorised officers, such as police, at the direction of the chief health officer, the power to detain people, restrict movement, prevent entry to premises or provide “any other direction an [authorised officer] considers reasonable to protect public health”.
Under the directive signed by the chief health officer, it is an offence for a person arriving from overseas to fail to go into self-isolation for 14 days. People must not leave the premises where they are self-isolating except for the purpose of obtaining medical care or supplies; in any other emergency situation; or in circumstances where it is possible to avoid close contact with other persons. They also cannot allow visitors into their home.
The penalty for failing to comply is a fine of almost $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for companies.
“We don’t anticipate having to be fining people,” Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said on Monday. “To this point people have been cooperative.”
Flight attendants and citizens or permanent residents of a Pacific Island are exempt.
The same directive bans mass gatherings of more than 500 people, exempting schools, airports, public transport, markets, workplaces, courts, prisons and youth justice facilities, parliament and public places where people are moving through, such as Bourke Street Mall and Federation Square.
Andrews said the powers could be extended to include the lockdown of whole suburbs.
People arriving in Queensland from overseas will be issued with a notice requesting them to voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days. If they breach that notice, the Queensland government says it will “initially work closely with the person to ensure they not only understand their obligations, but also the importance and seriousness of self-quarantine under the current global circumstances”.
If that fails, the notice is enforceable under the Public Health Act 2005 with fines of up to $13,345.
Queensland has been in a state of emergency since late January and can use those powers to enforce compliance if necessary – but it has repeatedly stated that it is aiming for willing community cooperation.
The ACT declared a public health emergency on Monday in response to Covid-19, which gives the chief health officer powers to enforce quarantine provisions, to order the evacuations of public areas, to restrict access to an area, and even to force someone to undergo medical examination.
Under those powers, anyone who breaches the order for travellers to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Australia could face a $8,000 fine, under the Public Health Act 1997.
Mass gatherings will be policed under the same legislation.
Western Australian invoked powers under the Emergency Management Act at midnight on Sunday to enforce self-isolation requirements.
Under the act, travellers who breach the 14-day self-isolation order are liable for a $50,000 fine or possible jail time.
The ban against mass gatherings is enforced under the same legislation, with the same penalty to apply.
Self-isolation requirements will be enforced under the Notifiable Diseases Act, which carries penalties of $1,256 or six months’ prison for breaching a public health order.
Di Stevens, the acting chief health officer, said she expected the community would monitor and police each other to ensure isolation orders were followed.
Mass gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned under the Public and Environmental Health Act.
That does not include schools, universities, public transport or attending the Darwin markets, chief minister Michael Gunner said.
Travel to remote communities for everyone but essential services, supply runs and maintenance runs has also been banned. Gunner said people in remote communities were not being “left alone” during the coronavirus outbreak and would have everything they needed to be healthy and safe.
“To protect you, we are keeping nonessential people away from you,” he said. “If you don’t need to travel out of your community, then don’t. Just like the rest of us you are safer in your home community.”
South Australia declared a public health emergency on Sunday. Premier Steven Marshall told AAP the declaration would allow public health officers to take “all the necessary actions required to keep the people of South Australia as safe as we possibly can”.
The SA parliament this month passed new laws giving public health officers greater powers to order a person to self-isolate, be detained in a particular place or agree to medical testing.
Failure to comply with orders under the revised Public Health Act 2011 carries a maximum fine of $25,000.
Tasmania was the first state to ban cruise ships from coming into port, and introduced measures banning mass gatherings of more than 500 people, and requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days, from midnight on Sunday.
Under the Public Health Act in Tasmania, the maximum fine for breaching an order to self-isolate is $8,400.
The ban on mass gatherings does not include markets, like Hobart’s Salamanca market, on the justification that those events involve people moving through and are therefore unlikely to result in someone having sustained close contact with a stranger. However school fetes and assemblies have been banned."

This is not going to be easy. While the government dithers, I have been self-isolating for a week (doctor’s advice for an existing cough). Plenty of other over 80s have been doing so, too: it is the sad destiny of the old and unfit to live that way already.
On the other hand, one of the joys of a healthy old age is the freedom it can bring those with children grown up, mortgage paid off, adequate pension. It is time to enjoy ourselves. And the old know how: witness the thriving golf clubs, bowling clubs, membership of friends groups – the National Trust, Royal Academy, theatres and orchestras around the country. Old people are the mainstay of their membership, volunteers and audiences. Then there are the outings: off-peak day returns to places of interest, a walk in the countryside and home before the crowds hit. Many of us live charmed lives.
So it is indeed a big ask. People with less life left than others are being asked to give up its remaining pleasures. No one is thinking this through … except the old themselves. Our younger family members need to help us do this: encouraging us to stay home and explaining how this whole new world of contacts and bonding will work. There will be new ways of being in touch – and families can embark on it together.
We are already making plans. We are firming up our online contacts. Some of us need to brush up our tech skills: I’m one of them, new to Skype, FaceTime and WhatsApp. But I know they will be important when I get gloomy and depressed. Our local networking group already has a list of volunteers standing ready to do the shopping. But questions remain: what about dental appointments, hairdressers, podiatrists? How will we manage to exercise if we are asked to stay indoors? I shall certainly be venturing out for a walk, alone and at a distance from others. I need a daily gulp of fresh air. It raises the question: how will the government’s “ask” for over-70s to stay indoors be policed?
Over the months, new ways of life will emerge. And we, the old, will do it for ourselves. We may well alight on new patterns of relating, coming together, sharing, that will survive the crisis, and make old age better."

How will coronavirus affect Australia's real estate market and house prices?
",Nigel Stapledon for the Conversation,"It will lose momentum and there could be falls. But it will be a short, sharp shock


Mon 16 Mar 2020 04.19 GMT


It’s one of the most googled questions since the Covid-19 outbreak began: how will coronavirus affect house prices?
The bottom line is it will be negative – prices will go down. People, up until now, have been talking about the property market developing a bit of momentum, with the interest rate cuts we had last year and the easing of credit conditions.
But coronavirus has changed the story for 2020.
The Reserve Bank cut rates soon after news broke of the developing coronavirus outbreak. On its own, that’s positive for the housing market (meaning prices stabilise or go up).
But the reason the bank is cutting is coronavirus is negatively impacting the economy as a whole – there’s no escaping that fact. Yes, the government has released its stimulus package and there may be more fiscal stimulus on the way, but there are limits to what any government can do. There will be negative effects on employment. It will be a short, sharp shock to the economy.
I fully expect a strong rebound by 2021 but, in the short term, it will hurt. There are sectors of the economy where people will lose jobs and it’s fair to say coronavirus is generating uncertainty more broadly in the community and, in turn, in the economy.
In the housing market the bottom line is there will be a pullback by buyers and that will take momentum out of the market, and we could see some price falls.
You can also look at what it’s done to other asset prices. Yes, interest rates are lower but other assets, notably equities, are being hit.
For a lot of people with wealth tied up in the share market, their wealth has been diminished. So capacity for many people to use that wealth to buy into the housing market has been reduced.
In this environment, buyers who are in very secure jobs are actually in an improved position because the overall market is weaker. Coronavirus will take out a group of buyers – those adopting a wait-and-see approach or those simply unable to buy due to reduced income.
But there’s another group of buyers: those who are in jobs but who face uncertainty about how coronavirus will affect their pay or whether they will keep their job at all.
Many of these types of buyers will be taken out of the housing market for now.
If you’re a seller, you need to appreciate that things are going to be weaker. Those would-be sellers who have flexibility will be able to defer and that could cushion prices falls.
There will still be people who need to sell for whatever reason. The turnover will decline but there will still be properties coming into the market.
The market has been getting more difficult for the investor. The market in, for example, Sydney is oversupplied at the moment and there’s already been some downward pressure on rents. Yes, investors can benefit somewhat from the decline in rates but that benefit is offset by declining rents.
Then, along comes coronavirus.
The weakness it is causing in the economy will accentuate the downward pressure on rents in the short term and that’s something investors need to be cognisant of.
If prices come down, investors could be in a better position to buy (to create or add to an existing property portfolio) but that weakness in rents is a real factor – it has been for some time and is unlikely to go away any time soon.
From state to state, each of the markets is doing slightly different things but the broad point applies across all markets. Coronavirus is everywhere. Its impacts on the property market will be everywhere too.
The Western Australian market has been weak for some time, and rents have fallen fairly drastically for quite a while now. There appear to be signs it could be stabilising but coronavirus won’t encourage that.
The Melbourne market has been strong and the vacancy rates aren’t as high, but there’s no doubt coronavirus will increase caution among many buyers and encourage a lot of sellers to defer.
2020 will, in many ways, be a hard year for the economy. Talk of a recession is growing and, while the big companies may not lay off a lot of people, a lot of small businesses are facing the prospect of low to no revenue. They may have no choice.
The financial capacity of small and medium-sized business will be harshly affected. If you’re a restaurant and nobody is coming in, you may have no option but to reduce staff or close. The stimulus package is well targeted but there’s no stimulus package in the world that could stop some of these effects happening.
The RBA has talked about a rebound in the second half of this year. Hopefully it’s right but I expect it at least by 2021. Either way, it’s important to remember the rebound will happen.
People will recover. People will go back to restaurants. People will go to football games. Things will eventually bounce back. Things will go back to normal eventually – but there will be some business casualties along the way.

Juggling work and kids is always a challenge, but now with the coronavirus shutting down schools, Dusti Arab knows she’s facing a reckoning. A mother of two living in the greater Portland, Oregon, area, Arab had just stopped working in an office and was looking forward to being able to focus on the small marketing agency she runs from her home when coronavirus hit. “This thing destroyed everything I had going on,” she said. “Everything’s a disaster here.”
So far she has had to cancel a long-held vacation plan to Europe and figure out how to accommodate her kids on what she now expects will be a very extended spring break. “My kids go to two different schools and are in different districts, so I’m managing a lot, trying to make sure my family and extended family are prepared for this,” she said.
Her husband, who typically works out of an office in downtown Portland, will also be working from home for at least the next two weeks, per company mandate – but that doesn’t fix her problems. “He’s great with helping with rides and getting the kids back and forth,” she said, “but this is primarily going to fall on my shoulders.”
Arab is one of millions of women who will find themselves needing to step up their roles at home as the coronavirus spreads. Study after study has shown that even as women have stepped forward in the workforce, in married heterosexual couples women still shoulder the bulk of household chores. (A Gallup poll from January found women were more than seven times as likely to care for their children on a daily basis as men in heterosexual married or cohabitating couples.) And 80% of single-parent families are headed by single mothers, according to 2019 US Census Bureau data.
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.
Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. In the UK any household where a person develops a fever or a new continuous cough are recommended to self-isolate for 14 days.
Justin McCurry
That means when kids come home from school, sick or otherwise – as they are and will be around the country in the coming days and weeks – the answer to the question of who takes care of them is gendered.
“Women are typically the chief healthcare officer, the chief entertainment officer, the chief education officer in their homes,” said Kristy Wallace, CEO of Ellevate Network, a group that supports women in the workplace. “In a time of crisis, a time where we don’t have a clear playbook but we do have a lot of panic and anxiety – the weight of these roles is quite overwhelming.”
Rachel Sklar, a single mother and gender advocate, sees the hardship posed by the pandemic two ways.
“There’s the Covid-19 mental load – are we ready, what do we need, fear of what’s going to happen – and then there is the mental load of the single parent in a one-income household after terrifying market drops and business grinding to a standstill,” said Sklar, who founded TheLi.st, an online community of professional women, in an email.
Her daughter’s father lives in Canada, she added, “So practically it’s just been me doing the prepping, and the reading about the prepping, and the gaming out contingencies, weighing whether to go to gymnastics and swimming, conferring with my co-founder about how best to support our members (I run an online network of professional women), conferring with clients (I am also a consultant to early-stage startups) and pitching articles (I am also a writer!).”
Already total shutdowns have been announced in 23 states, as well as in large urban areas like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington DC. Experts expect daycare centers may soon also close en masse, and some already have.
Such headlines are especially bad news for mothers, who already do 2.6 times as much unpaid caregiving and domestic work as their heterosexual partners, according to a recent report from the United Nations. And in the face of a pandemic such dynamics will only be exacerbated, with the elderly – whose care is also primarily shouldered by women – needing more care than ever, and the sick proliferating.
Julie Kohler, a single mother in DC who works for Democracy Alliance and a fellow in residence at the National Women’s Law Center, is reducing her work hours to care for her five-year-old son.
As his sole legal guardian, Kohler is fortunate to have a babysitter who helps out part-time. (She has decided she will continue to pay her babysitter’s weekly salary regardless of whether she’s able to come to work or not during the crisis.)
But as a scholar of family social science, the upheaval has only served to highlight to her how inadequate individual responses are in face of a pandemic.
“We can try to do the right things individually but we really need government leadership at a time like this,” Kohler said, ticking down a list of US policy solutions that would help support women caregivers like paid family leave, paid sick leave and other family-focused social programs she would like to see enacted.
On Saturday, the House passed a coronavirus relief package that would help assist working families by granting employees affected by the coronavirus crisis up to 12 weeks of paid leave should they need to go into quarantine, care for a quarantined family member, or look after a child whose school is closed, though the provision would apply only to employers with fewer than 500 employees. The bill is expected to be taken up by the Senate as early as Monday.
In a statement last week, Tina Tchen, the CEO of Time’s Up, called providing paid sick leave “key to unlocking deeply entrenched gender, racial and economic disparities,” noting that “the majority of our healthcare and public health workforce are women, who are on the frontlines of the fight to stop the spread of the coronavirus.”
Antonina Mamzenko, a freelance photographer who works flexibly from home to accommodate the schedule of her home-educated son, said the crisis has created a ton of new work for her individually.
“I definitely found that everything coronavirus-related fell on me, from staying on top of news and learning about the symptoms, to having pep talks with my nine-year-old and explaining what all this means without making him too anxious, to reminding him to go wash his hands, to noting if any of us have symptoms, to making the decisions as to whether to stay home or go to classes and clubs, and manage work around all of that too,” she said in an email.
“It’s frustrating but I’m definitely used to it. It seems just so par for the course that I’m expected to be the one managing it all.”"

Film director Paul Schrader has castigated the producers of his current film after the shoot was shut down after one of the actors was diagnosed with coronavirus.
In a brief post on Facebook, Schrader said his producers had stopped the production five days before it was due to finish “because an LA day player had the coronavirus”.
He added: “Myself, I would have shot through hellfire rain to complete the film. I’m old and asthmatic, what better way to die than on the job?”
Schrader had been shooting a film of his own script, The Card Counter, which stars Oscar Isaac as a professional gambler called William Tell who takes an angry kid (played by Tye Sheridan) out for revenge, on the casino circuit. Willem Dafoe and Tiffany Haddish also star.
The Card Counter had been filming in Biloxi, Mississippi. The actor concerned is not one of the principal cast.
Schrader, who has script-writing credits on Martin Scorsese films including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ, and has directed influential films such as American Gigolo and Light Sleeper, engineered a career revival in 2013 with The Canyons. He received a best screenplay Oscar nomination for his 2017 film First Reformed."

Readings of Shakespeare plays will be streamed online by a group seeking to entertain those who “do not like Netflix” after all major British theatres closed their doors.Lucy Aarden, a professional actor who has been cast in the lead role of Julia for the hastily organised production of The Two Gentleman of Verona said three different companies cancelled her upcoming work this morning and she was delighted to be cast in the unpaid role.
The streamed performance on Thursday, she said, would continue weekly with the playwrights’ works in chronological order, and allow actors and theatre makers to stay connected with each other.
“My dog has also been cast,” she said. “Hopefully when it’s his bit he’ll bark. I’m going to get his cues shortly.”
She said the reading, directed by Rob Myles and introduced by renowned Shakespeare expert Ben Crystal, would also include amateur actors, and that she was already rehearsing for her role alone at home after being cast earlier today.
“150 now unemployed actors got in touch from different time zones across the globe to take part,” she said. “It’s a really nice platform for actors. No one is going to theatres for the foreseeable. And not everyone likes Netflix.”
In what seems apt during times of crisis, she will say:

On the day that Royal Mail workers have voted hugely in favour of strikes in a long-running dispute over job security and the company’s future direction, they have also offered to serve as an additional coronavirus emergency service in the UK.
A statement reads:
If we can agree the introduction of the very best health and safety provisions and equipment that can guarantee our members safety, they will become an additional emergency service. 
 Postal workers can play a crucial role in to keep everyone in this country connected & informed, delivering medical aid, checking on the elderly and vulnerable, delivering local to local services and supporting people working from home. We could also assist with food bank collections and the delivery of food parcels to those most in need. 
In any national emergency in our history and in our day to day existence the universal postal service has played a vital role, these unprecedented events remind us all of that postal workers always come through and will stand ready to serve the nation again but Royal Mail Group must play their part by agreeing our proposal and ensuring the very best standards of safety and support to its employees.
We will be writing to the prime minister to gain the governments support for this approach. 
In the meantime, we will meet with the company tomorrow to move this proposal forward.

AAP has just filed its take on what was a surprise late evening announcement. 
Australians are being urged to fly home as soon as possible to avoid being stranded overseas due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Travel advice issued on Tuesday evening by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Australians should return home before the virus caused more borders to close. 
Travellers are also being urged to reconsider their need to go overseas.
“If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means,” the advice read. 
“You may not be able to return to Australia when you had planned to. Consider whether you have access to health care and support systems if you get sick while overseas.”
From midday on Tuesday Australians were no longer able to travel to Europe, with an initial EU ban in place for 30 days.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is meeting the national cabinet on Tuesday evening, with new precautionary measures likely to be announced on Wednesday.

The foreign affairs department has told Australians via its smart traveller website that they should consider returning home if abroad given the ongoing uncertainty about whether people can still travel.
“We now advise all Australians to reconsider your need for overseas travel at this time,” Dfat says.
“If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means.
“Regardless of your destination, age or health, if your overseas travel is not essential, consider carefully whether now is the right time.”
Given more and more countries are closing their borders or introducing travel restrictions, Dfat advises travel is complex and difficult and people may not be able to return to Australia when they need to. 
“If you decide to return to Australia, do so as soon as possible. Commercial options may become less available,” Dfat says.Dfat says it is issuing this advice because there may be a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 overseas, in airports, during long-haul flights, and the health care systems of other countries might not be able to support foreigners.
Australians returning from overseas will need to quarantine themselves for 14 days.

NRL players are being told to avoid contact with people as much as possible outside of training and games.
NRL officials met with the health minister, Greg Hunt, today about what the best strategy for its players should be amid the pandemic.
One idea reportedly being considered is for players to stay home when not training or playing, and non-essential staff told to work from home.
Rabbitohs players have reportedly been told not to go out to restaurants and cafes.

More on the WA cases, via AAP:
Three healthcare workers returned to work in Perth after contracting coronavirus overseas, with one of them completing several shifts at an aged care facility before prompting a lockdown.
An Aegis Aged Care Group spokesman told AAP the man worked at a transition facility in Bayswater before returning positive test results.
He was among 10 cases confirmed on Monday, when the facility was close to its capacity of 30.
“We are working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that all relevant tracking is taking place for all who may have had any contact with the staff member,” a company statement read.
“No other Aegis facility is affected by this single COVID-19 case and we are maintaining our already strict infection control protocols.”
The spokesman said no residents were currently showing any symptoms.
The two other infected healthcare staff work at Joondalup private hospital, and the state health minister, Roger Cook, said operator Ramsay Health Care would comment further.
Special testing arrangements have been introduced for healthcare workers with fever or flu-like symptoms.

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.
No. In the UK, the medical advice is now that the household of anyone who develops a new persistent cough or high temperature should all stay at home for 14 days, keeping away from other people. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.
You should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.
China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. There is now extensive human to human transmission across the world.
As of 15 March, more than 182,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have been over 7,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 79,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.
We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.
Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected."

New rapid Covid-19 testing kit can return results in 15 minutes but not yet available in Australia

The federal health department says it sees “merit” in a newly developed rapid Covid-19 testing kit able to return results within 15 minutes, which experts say could help relieve significant pressure on pathology services.
Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has warned the country faces “extreme pressure” supplying enough testing kits as the rate of infection continues to skyrocket, warning last week that the number of pathology testing kits, reagents and swabs was “deteriorating rapidly” with some regions now completely out of supplies.
The government has so far refused to say how many testing kits remain in the country, although the health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Tuesday the supply was “sufficient for current requirements”.
As the virus spread in Wuhan, Chinese researchers developed a more rapid “point of care” screening test, which detects antibodies that emerge some time after Covid-19 symptoms appear. A study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology said the test could return results within 15 minutes, much faster than the current standard testing.
The test – known as the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit – is not currently in use in Australia, but the Guardian understands some companies are seeking to supply it onto the market.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the rapid test had “merit” and that there were “no compelling reasons not to use it based on the described science and methodology”.
But she said the company behind it, the Nantong Egens Biotechnology Company Ltd, had not yet approached the regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for assessment and approval.
Such a device would need to be approved through the TGA’s in-vitro diagnostics regulatory scheme before use, the department said.
The company has had the test validated by laboratories in Europe and China. But the spokeswoman said the same would need to occur in Australia.
“Tests also require validation by testing laboratories in the Australian context before use,” she said.
“The Department of Health, in collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Network, is monitoring the development of test kits and methodologies and their performance as they are used more widely around the world.”
In Australia, a company called Rapid COVID-19 is representing three manufacturers seeking to get TGA approval for the rapid tests. A company spokesman said: “Our TGA consultants have told us that unlike the US and Europe, securing approval will take too long and be very expensive.”
Experts approached by the Guardian said the testing had potential benefits and drawbacks. The testing does not require a laboratory, which could help alleviate pressure on Australia’s pathology services and the rest of the health system.
Andrew White, a virologist from the University of New South Wales, said if it were possible for rapid tests to be used by people at home it would help take the burden off an already strained health system.
“These tests will be useful for sure, they could keep infected people out of the health system and they do also provide peace of mind,” he said.
“There are certainly some advantages. If someone thinks they have the virus and can do the test at home in 15 minutes that’s someone who isn’t presenting at a hospital, GP or pathology lab.
“Even if you received a false positive, if you were able to take the precaution of having it backed up with [a traditional test] it would be good. If people received a negative result, they might be less inclined to visit the clinic which is going to free up hospital resources.”
But, he stressed, the tests were not always as reliable as those currently being used in Australia. Because rapid test kits look for antibodies associated with the virus rather than the virus itself, they could record false-negatives if used at the wrong time.
“The question is how significant those limitations are. It depends really on how many true cases you detect. Does it detect every positive, or does it miss 5%?” he said
“Because if you have to back up every test with a lab pathology test it might defeat the purpose a little bit.”
Bill Bowtell, an infectious diseases expert from the Kirby Institute, said while there was no shortage of medical supply companies looking to profit off the Covid-19 crisis, the TGA would need to consider the kits closely.
“In the end, anybody with anything to sell is in the market and their interest is to make the biggest claims,” he said.
“I think that’s the case with a lot of the things that we’ll see coming onto the market. There’s uncertainty because it didn’t come to market after stringent testing, it came to the market because there’s a feeling of ‘my god we need it’.
“In normal circumstances you wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole but this is what happens when there’s a crisis.”"

Caroline Davies","Duke and Duchess of Sussex take ‘measures’ as monarch cancels garden parties


Tue 17 Mar 2020 16.04 GMT


First published on Tue 17 Mar 2020 14.42 GMT


The Queen will decamp to Windsor Castle, cancel her traditional garden parties and postpone investitures as the threat of coronavirus triggers a wholesale ripping up of the royal diaries for all members of her family.
Buckingham Palace announced that the monarch, who will be 94 next month, would be leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday.
“Her Majesty will move to Windsor Castle for the Easter period on Thursday 19 March, one week earlier than planned. It is likely the Queen will stay there beyond the Easter period,” it said.
The precautionary measures follow the government’s announcement that the spread of coronavirus in London is thought to be some weeks ahead of the rest of UK.
Officials are concerned for the welfare of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, who since retiring spends his time on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be taking “appropriate measures” over coronavirus after suggestions that Prince Harry could have been exposed to it during his final UK engagements this month.
Harry hugged Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton as the two opened the Silverstone Experience Centre on 6 March.
Two days before, Hamilton was photographed at the WE Day UK charity events in London alongside the actor Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister – both of whom have since tested positive for Covid-19.
The Queen has already cancelled planned engagements in Cheshire and Camden as a “sensible precaution” because of her propensity to attract crowds, and to prevent any drain on over-stretched services required to host such public events.
Following consultation between her medical household and the government, other events pencilled in for “the coming months” are also now being cancelled as part of unprecedented peacetime measures to try and control the spread of the virus. These include the Maundy service at St George’s chapel on 9 April.
“Three garden parties hosted by the Queen, due to be held at Buckingham Palace in May, will not now take place,” a Buckingham Palace spokesman said.
“Guests already invited to these garden parties will be asked to attend in 2021.
“Two additional garden parties given for the Not Forgotten Association and the National Trust will also not take place.” A decision is yet to be made on the annual garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.
The cancellation of the Queen’s garden parties is thought to be unprecedented. Palace officials could not recall a similar occasion in recent memory.
Trooping the Colour, one of the annual highlights of the royal calendar and one of the family events which the Prince Harry and Meghan were expected to attend, is also in doubt, as is the 75th anniversary of VE Day and the state visit by the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Further announcements on these “will be made in due course in consultation with the government”.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on whether Harry and Meghan were self-isolating at their Vancouver Island retreat. One source said that that the couple would be taking “appropriate measures and following government advice”.
Trudeau announced last week that she had put herself in quarantine, having been tested after experiencing mild symptoms on her return from London.
Elba revealed on Monday he had tested positive via a video on Twitter, in which he said he felt OK and that he had no symptoms but had decided to self-isolate. The Luther actor said he only got tested after coming into contact with someone who later confirmed they had coronavirus, but did not give details of who that person was.
Hamilton has urged fans to take coronavirus seriously, and has posted a video showing how to hand-wash on his Twitter account. It is not known if he has been tested for the virus.
Harry flew back to Canada just before Justin Trudeau announced the closure of Canada’s borders to stop the spread. Trudeau has urged Canadians to stay at home “as much as possible”."

The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Australians to return home as soon as possible by commercial means because overseas travel is becoming “more complex and difficult” as countries impose travel restrictions and close their borders.
The new travel advice, issued on Tuesday night, triggered speculation that the Morrison government could be about to impose a lockdown in Australia. But officials told Guardian Australia that was not in contemplation.
Governments are poised to unveil new social distancing measures after a meeting between Scott Morrison and the premiers on Tuesday night. Leaders discussed additional restrictions on indoor gatherings and new measures for the aged care sector and remote Indigenous communities.
As well as the efforts to slow community transmissions of the illness, the Morrison government is also preparing a second multibillion-dollar “safety net” package. The Coalition is considering a boost to income support for welfare recipients and support for businesses at risk as a consequence of economic shock associated with the coronavirus.
While a second round of pump priming is being prepared, senior ministers on Tuesday warned the extra spending will not be enough to avoid widespread job losses stemming from the Covid-19 health crisis.
The health minister, Greg Hunt, on Tuesday also flagged a massive scaling up of public testing for the disease amid concern over test kit shortages, saying he will make a “major announcement” on the country’s testing regime on Wednesday.
According to the Department of Health, the global shortage of test kits is the reason behind the government’s decision to undertake targeted, rather than widespread testing.
The new Dfat travel advice asks Australians to reassess all overseas travel if it is non-essential, and it says: “If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means”.
Given more and more countries are closing their borders or introducing travel restrictions, Dfat advised people may not be able to return to Australia when they need to. “If you decide to return to Australia, do so as soon as possible. Commercial options may become less available,” Dfat said.
The department said the advice had been adjusted because there may be a higher risk of contracting the virus overseas and “you may come in contact with more people than usual, including during long-haul flights and in crowded airports”. It says health systems in some countries “may come under strain and may not be as well-equipped as Australia’s or have the capacity to support foreigners”.
“Overseas travel has become more complex and unpredictable. Many countries are introducing entry or movement restrictions. These are changing often and quickly. Your travel plans may be disrupted. You may be placed in quarantine or denied entry to some countries, and you may need to self-quarantine on return to Australia”.
“Think about what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities”.
As of Tuesday, there are 438 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia, with a third federal politician – the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg – among the latest to test positive to the disease.
Three senators who attended a committee hearing with Bragg last week – Jenny McAllister, Tony Sheldon and Rex Patrick – are now in self-isolation.
The rapidly escalating crisis has prompted the Coalition to hastily develop another wave of economic stimulus, which is expected to be more far-reaching than the $17.6bn package announced last week.
Federal cabinet discussed options in a meeting on Tuesday, with the measures also discussed by the cabinet’s expenditure review committee, however it is understood no final decisions have been made.
The government is looking at ways to ramp up support through existing programs and mechanisms, but the package is unlikely to be announced until after the Reserve Bank of Australia intervenes again on Thursday either through another emergency rate cut or a significant purchase of government bonds.
It is expected the government will put the new measures to a scaled-down parliament next week to be voted on before the Easter break and the May budget.
It is possible the government will also a deliver a separate assistance package for airlines in advance of unveiling the second round of stimulus either at the weekend or early next week. Qantas has signalled it will close 90% of international flights and 60% of domestic flights from the end of the month.
The government and the opposition have agreed that only 90 of the country’s 151 MPs will come to Canberra for the next parliamentary session, along with 54 of the country’s 76 senators.
The package is expected to target both heavily affected industries as well as vulnerable low-income earners.
However, even with the extra billions of dollars in government support, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, warned that the “grim reality” was that jobs would be lost as the country faced an “unprecedented” economic shutdown.
“We are very conscious that as we are looking at things today, that many businesses will close and many Australians will lose their jobs,” Cormann said on Tuesday.
“We will ensure that they have got the appropriate levels of support through this transition to the other side when there will be a strong bounce back and a strong recovery.”
The finance minister also revealed that the government was looking at specific measures to help vulnerable low-income earners, who he conceded would be hard hit by a downturn.
“We are very seriously considering what appropriate supports we can provide, in particular to the most vulnerable across our community and specifically those that are most severely impacted,” Cormann said.
“This is going to be a tough period. There will be a strong recovery on the other side, but it is going to be a tough period. We are all in this together. We are going to come up with the best possible way to get ourselves through this period.”
Amid calls for the government to do more to protect casual workers, the minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said the existing social safety net was the best delivery mechanism “for those who will need help in the challenging times ahead”.
“But however many people may require help in the challenging times ahead, because they find they are not able to work or because they have experienced unemployment due to changed economic conditions, the best assistance mechanism is the welfare system because of its proven ability to deliver income support to affected workers,” Porter told Guardian Australia.
“This is the most effective way to ensure income support reaches those in need as simply and quickly as possible, with regular waiting periods waived.”
Porter said that while the government was not considering “wholesale structural change” to the industrial relations system, those most affected needed “income support until things improve”.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, called on the government to offer more support for anyone in the workforce who has to self-isolate without access to an income – including both employees and small business people.
“Many businesses are paying to cover periods in isolation, even where there is no legal obligation to do so,” Pearson said.
“But small, family-owned businesses struggling to survive, let alone retain the staff they have, do not have the resources to support additional payments for casuals.”"

What effect will winter have on coronavirus in Australia?

Graham Readfearn","As the southern hemisphere winter looms, cooler temperatures may affect the behaviour of the virus – and of people, who tend to spend more time close together indoors


Tue 17 Mar 2020 03.12 GMT


Last modified on Tue 17 Mar 2020 04.56 GMT


In many parts of the world, wintertime tends to be when people get sick from viruses that cause colds and influenza.
The illness Covid-19 broke out in China’s winter and spread in Iran, Italy and the rest of Europe as those countries endured their coldest months.
As Australia heads into winter, what could this mean for the spread of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes the Covid-19 illness?
Experts have told Guardian Australia that cooler temperatures can affect the behaviour and spread of a virus in three interconnected ways.
Firstly, temperatures can affect the virus directly.
Some viruses may have a temperature range where they can survive for longer and this is partly dependent on their “envelope” – the outer layer that’s made of lipids (which is why washing hands with soap is effective, because it disrupts the lipids).
Secondly, when temperatures drop, this changes the behaviour of the human population. People tend to spend more time indoors and in closer contact, making it easier for the virus to spread.
Thirdly, we already know that like in other parts of the world, winter in Australia is when other viruses circulate and this can affect the immunity of populations.
Associate Prof Tom Kotsimbos of Monash University, who is also a respiratory physician at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, says seasonality can cause an increase in the spread of viruses.
“That is well established, but whether we understand that deeply is another thing. It does have an influence, but we don’t understand it specifically. This is a new virus, and that does not mean it will be like the others.
“We know it’s about the biology of the virus, the general and specific immunity of us and the environmental and behavioural conditions,” he says.
But there is much less certainty, he says, about how important each factor is when it comes if a person gets sick.
“It’s interesting that [Covid-19] has spread all over the world quite quickly – both north and south,” he said, adding that this suggested either the new virus was not dependent on temperature or that this dependency was not as important as the lack of immunity in the population that was helping it to spread.
Some studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed have tried to find out if there is a clear link between temperature and the rate of infection of the coronavirus, but have been inconclusive or contradictory.
Dr Meru Sheel of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at Australian National University, says: “There is no clear evidence to suggest a relationship between outdoor temperatures and spread of coronaviruses.
“We don’t know enough about Sars-CoV-2 yet to know how change in weather will affect outbreak and the disease epidemiology.
“In some tropical countries such as Pacific Island countries, despite the warm weather, there is some seasonal influenza activity and it is related to increase in travellers from countries such as Australia and New Zealand and to a much lesser extent related to change in weather.”
Sheel said studies are under way investigating the duration of the survival of Sars-CoV-2 under different conditions and on different surfaces.
“Evidence from these studies is likely to improve our understanding of the disease transmission pathways and improve our response strategy.
“However until we know more, we need to ensure that all surfaces are decontaminated using disinfectants such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, bleach etc – based on local infection, prevention and control guidelines.”
Sheel pointed to a review of research into other known human coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers, that found the viruses survived for varying lengths of time.
The study found they could be infectious on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, metal, wood and paper for up to nine days, but disinfectant cleaning was effective.
Sheel says rather than the temperature itself, the change in the way Covid-19 spreads “is likely influenced by frequency at which people interact during cooler versus warmer weather”.
Dr Chris Burrell, emeritus professor of virology of the University of Adelaide, said there were other known coronaviruses that had been around for half a century and these were also prevalent in winter.
“But that’s because of people congregating together,” he said.
He said one example of this effect was with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that causes a common respiratory disease in young children that tends to arrive in winter.
Burrell says: “If you think of children in preschool, in the summer they’re out in the sun and don’t have a lot of personal contact with each other. In winter, they’re inside and breathing the same air.
“I think that any effect of temperature on coronavirus won’t be nearly as important as the effect of limiting its spread by isolating people.”
Ten years ago Tom Kotsimbos led a taskforce of respiratory specialists that looked at what impact a potential early winter arrival of swine flu could have on Australia’s population.
He said the same questions that were being asked then – about the influence of temperature and the overlap with Australia’s flu season – are being asked again now.
“Clearly this is a different virus – but we have been here before ... but we don’t know how Covid-19 will behave.
“On an individual level, if you get a virus when your defences are already down from a recent viral infection, then that could be increasingly challenging with the progression of the disease.
“Previous studies have suggested that if you have recently recovered from a viral infection then your innate immune systems may actually be bolstered and that might help with subsequent attacks.”
He said adding the impacts of Covid-19 on top of flu season “will put an incredible stress on the healthcare system”.
Dr Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said: “My concern is that [in winter] people tend to be in closer contact and it coincides with our flu season.
“My main concern is that when you think of the healthcare system, that does get pushed in a bad flu season. If we combine a moderate flu season with a moderate coronavirus season, that could be problematic.”
Sheel said: “As Australia moves into cooler weather, we are likely to see an increase in respiratory diseases such as common colds, influenza and RSV infections.
“To minimise the pressure on the health system it will be important for the community to adopt public health prevention measures, get vaccinated and staying at home when unwell – practising social distancing.
“This will also help improve our ability to test for Covid-19 and in return protect our vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions and minimise their risk of exposure to infection with Covid-19. All these factors will contribute towards better control of the outbreak.”"

After pictures of Florida beaches packed with spring breakers appeared on social media, Florida Governor Rick DeSantis has issued an executive order in an effort to quell critics. 
However, his new order is muddy at best. 
BUSY BEACH! This is what @MyClearwater Beach looks like right now as spring break crowds flock to the sand. #Clearwater leaders haven’t decided if they should add a curfew or close beaches but they may vote on measures related to the #coronavirus this Thursday. @abcactionnews pic.twitter.com/jGoxQdYJg5
The order closes nightclubs and bars for 30 days, but encourages restaurants to stay open while only seating people at half-capacity. Restaurants are also required to stagger seating. The order also asks people not to go to public beaches in groups greater than 10, “per CDC guidance”. 
However, the CDC has strongly encouraged people to go much further than DeSantis’s order. The CDC has directed people “avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts,” to “avoid travel, shopping trips, and social visits”.These practices are part of “social distancing”. Here’s an expert guide on how to practice social distancing and slow the spread of the virus.

The Guardian’s tech reporter Kari Paul reports: 
Shared scooter company Lime is suspending services in US markets including California and Washington state, as well as in Italy, France, Spain, due to coronavirus concerns, it said in a statement on Monday evening. 
The company, which is owned by Uber, said it is pausing services to “help people stay put, and stay safe” as a number of states and cities enact shelter in place orders. Uber and other rideshare services are not affected by the shelter in place order in California as they are considered essential businesses, but Lime is still shutting down services.
“In the Bay Area we are temporarily pausing operations and taking scooters offline to comply with government orders, and we ask the Lime community to do their part in protecting themselves and each other”, a spokesman said. “We are committed to quickly reactivating once the coronavirus virus is under control”.
Lyft is still running its scooters, it said in a Monday email, and regularly sanitizing them. Bay Area residents could still be seen riding them Monday, some wearing masks. Bird, another commonly used shared scooter startup in the Bay Area, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the status of its program.

“The bottom line is, as a matter of course and in the everyday affairs of this country, I believe very much that we should not be growing the debt,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told reporters on Capitol Hill. But he added: “These are not normal times. The circumstances in which we live in now have no precedent.”
He seemed positive that lawmakers woud pass some sort of stimulus package. “I think really now it’s a question of drafting it and crafting it in a way that can pass and that will work soon enough,” he said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is discussing a stimulus plan that would include sending out $250bn worth of checks to Americans, amounting to two weeks of pay, by the end of April, according to multiple reports. 
INSIDE THE SENATE R-MNUCHIN LUNCHMNUCHIN said he wants to send out $250 billion worth of checks — means tested. First wave would go out at the end of April. If TRUMP has not ended the natl emergency, another wave goes out four weeks later. Mnuchin notes he’s working with IRS
Mnuchin met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors to discuss a stimulus package which would also include aid for the airline industry, small-business support and a payroll tax holiday. The totals cost of the stimulus package is estimated to be between $800bn and $1 trillion, per reports.

Medical and student debt owed to New York state will be temporarily suspended, according to the state’s attorney general. “In this time of crisis, I won’t add undue stress or saddle NYers with unnecessary financial burden, this is the time to support residents,” said attorney general Letitia James, in a tweet. 
Effective immediately, I'm temporarily halting the collection of state medical & student debt owed to NYS that was referred to my office. In this time of crisis, I won't add undue stress or saddle NYers with unnecessary financial burden, this is the time to support residents.
James’ measure won’t affect debt owed to the federal government but will bring some temporary relief to those who owe the state government.

The virus that causes COVID-19 can survive for hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces, according to new research from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and universities.
The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that SARS-CoV-2 was detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 
NIH scientists advise that people clean and disinfect frequently touched objects using regular household cleaning sprays.

Duncan Hunter, the disgraced California congressman who pleaded guilty to stealing his campaign funds and spending the money on vacations, school tuition for his children and shopping sprees, has been sentenced to 11 months in prison. 
His attornies had asked for home confinement, citing his military and congressional service. Hunter resigned from Congress in January after serving nearly six terms representing one of California’s last solidly red districts. 
A district court judge also sentenced Hunter to three years of supervised release.

The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports:
Rebecca Gross, 16, showed up to work as a student election judge at 5 a.m. this morning, but said election officials had yet to deliver any of the equipment needed to run an election by midday to her precinct.“No people at our precinct are able to vote,” she said in an interview. She said election workers at her precinct in Chicago’s Boystown neighborhood had been trying to contact local election officials, but were sent to a full voice mailbox.
Gross said she and other election workers began redirecting people to a nearby precinct where they could vote. So far, she estimated they had turned away about 75 people. “It sucks, honestly,” she said of redirecting people. “A lot of people have ended up saying ‘I actually can’t do that, I have work.’”
Amid fears about the coronavirus, Gross said she brought her own wipes and gloves from home to share with other workers. The only materials election officials provided to the poll workers at her precinct were four bottles of hand sanitizer and one roll of Clorox wipes.

 Gross said she thinks Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, should have moved to postpone the primary election, following the lead of a handful of other states that have chosen to do so.

Maanvi Singh, here. I’ll be bringing you more updates on the administration’s evolving response to the coronavirus pandemic. In the meantime, voting is still underway in Illinois. Officials say they’ve taken precautions to protect poll workers shortages and confusion over polling locations.
It seems some voters are also donating sanitizing products in order to help keep poll workers safe.

The White House coronavirus task force press briefing just wrapped up after an hour and half. I’m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, now and she will take you through the next few busy hours. Then Joanie Greve in Washington will be your blogger for the primary results this evening.
Here are some of the key events so far today:

The president and Republican leaders have been strongly criticized for referring to coronavirus as the Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, reflecting where the pandemic began.
The Guardian’s David Smith, at the White House coronavirus task force briefing now still going on in Washington, just asked Donald Trump about his use once gain, just this morning on Twitter, of the title “Chinese virus”.
Trump defended it. “China was putting out information that our military gave it to them. We have to call it where it came from, it came from China,” he said.
But would that perpetuate stigma, Smith asked in his follow-up, against China and the Chinese?
Trump said: “Saying that our military gave it to them, that creates a stigma,” he said. The race to the bottom continues.
A prominent Chinese official last week promulgated the inaccurate notion that coronavirus may have been brought to the city of Wuhan (where the outbreak began) by the US army.
Here’s the relevant tweet from Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao.
2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3
Ah, Trump now returning to familiar territory, slamming the mainstream media for not praising his and his administration’s approach to tackling coronavirus.

The man who first said words to the effect that the coronavirus was a Democratic party hoax and a media fantasy just emphasized once again, in this new week for Donald Trump, how seriously everyone needs to take the virus. And how seriously he is taking it.
“We are looking at saving the maximum number of lives. Everything else will come back, lives do not come back,” the president just said at the White House briefing now ongoing.
“This is a pandemic,” he stated. Then he stepped outside the truth.
“I have always viewed it as very serious,” he said.
As the Guardian’s David Smith wrote in that article:
Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was “very much under control” and infections were “going very substantially down, not up”. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be “close to zero”.
He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as “their new hoax”, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). 
But the usual playbook of deny and distract proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.

One of the most concerning issues since the emergence of the Covid-19 virus has been whether those who have had it can get it a second time – and what that means for immunity.
On Monday, both Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, Boris Johnson’s chief medical adviser, sought to reassure the public. Those who have had the virus once will develop some immunity, they said – and it is rare to get an infectious disease again.
The questions first arose last month, after Japanese authorities said a woman who had had the virus, and been declared virus-free, had tested positive again. Scientists were left confused by the news and and also uneasy.
Prof Mark Harris, an expert in virology at Leeds University, said reinfection in that case was “unlikely”, but added that “there is some evidence in the scientific literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses (mainly in bats)”.
When Vallance was asked on Monday if the Japanese case meant herd immunity was no longer achievable, he replied that some people do catch infectious diseases a second time, but that it is a rare occurrence. There was no evidence to suggest that it would occur with the coronavirus, he added.
Prof Whitty explained that with diseases, even if there is no long-term immunity, there is normally some short-term immunity.
Prof Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, said: “The answer is that we simply don’t know [about reinfection] yet because we don’t have an antibody test for the infection, although we will have soon.
“However, it is very likely, based on other viral infections, that yes, once a person has had the infection they will generally be immune and won’t get it again. There will always be the odd exception, but that is certainly a reasonable expectation.” "

","For some, workplaces are hotspots. For the over-65s, it’s shops and restaurants. We urgently need to change our behaviour
Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.
Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for diseases like Sars, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness – it is easy to recognise people who are infected.
In the case of Covid-19, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why airport screening at arrival is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, containment has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.
So how does an epidemic spread through a population – and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as R), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.
The larger the value of R, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to 1.4 new infections. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the early stages of an outbreak. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.
In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce R below 1. For diseases such as measles, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on R. For R of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for R of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get R below 1.
However, an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.
Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.
Another option to reduce the duration of infection is continued testing; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).
If we can’t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds with hot water and soap, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick – all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.
Cancelling large gatherings, working from home and school closures are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.
But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called BBC Pandemic, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.
What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 – who are particularly at risk from severe Covid-19 illness – make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.
Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number R, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.
We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it. Starting now, and for the duration of this epidemic, we all have a role to play and a responsibility to modify our behaviour in order to protect the ones who are most at risk.

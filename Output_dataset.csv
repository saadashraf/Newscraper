Universities Scotland has said in a statement that the country’s higher education institutions will remain open – subject to expert advice – but that teaching and assessments will shift online.
Universities have no plans to close. The way that universities deliver their teaching and other services will change over the coming weeks, in light of new advice, and to recognise that students may wish to work from home, in the UK or overseas. 
Universities will not close as they have commitments to students, including those who live on campus. Many research facilities must run around the clock and student support and IT infrastructure systems require continuous attention.
Now that the UK has moved into the ‘delay’ phase of the outbreak, many universities will start to transition to online learning and assessment for students in subjects where this is possible. They will offer revised guidance for staff who may need to work remotely.
The precise pace of this transition will vary by institution, reflecting different term dates and other factors. As large institutions, which educate and employ many thousands of people, it is sensible that we are responsive to this outbreak, in a manner that is consistent with public health advice.

French president Emmanuel Macron has said the government had no option but to impose stricter measures to tackle the coronavirus, but that the country would get through the crisis if it acted responsibly.
“I am the guarantor of the health of our citizens and also the democratic life of our country,” he said, defending his decision to hold local elections – which have been postponed in the UK.
“We will overcome this crisis by being responsible together and for each other,” he said, after casting his vote in northern France.
Macron said the decision to close shops and restaurants needed to be made because too many people were being too lax in how they protected themselves from the virus. 
Meanwhile, a reader in the Rhône valley, in the south of France, has been in touch to say voters have been asked to bring their own pens to the polling stations.

The Scottish government is not planning to ask over-70’s to self-isolate, contrary to the UK government.
Instead, elderly people in Scotland will be asked to reduce social contact.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish health secretary confirmed the plans after UK health secretary Hancock said potential future measures to force over-70s to stay at home were a “very big ask”, but said it would be for their own “self-protection”.
Asked about whether Scotland would follow suit, Freeman said: 
The additional measures that we’ve always talked about are about reducing contact for those over 70 and in their eighties, asking them to reduce their social contact because they are one of the groups who are most at risk of this virus making them seriously ill.
The other group is people who have underlying health conditions whose immune system is suppressed. It’s not isolation, it’s asking them to reduce social contact.
We don’t want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them. What were saying to them is, reduce your contact.
The news of the potential isolation of elderly people was briefed anonymously to journalists overnight and has led to criticism over how the UK government is communicating policies and advice. 
Overnight anonymous briefings to Sunday journalists are common, but there have been calls for a new approach in light of the pandemic.
Asked about how the news emerged, Freeman said: 
It’s not how we would do it. Government’s should be coming and explaining these things really clearly.
Overnight briefing, background briefing, unattributed sources is not the way to ensure that the public are understanding what we are trying to do and our working with us to do that.
Giving clear and consistent information to public at the right time on #coronavirus is vital. Governments’ media strategies must reflect the importance of that. This is not a run of the mill political issue. @scotgov will set out advice to the public in an orderly manner.

Urgent efforts to repatriate 30,000 British tourists from ski resorts in France are under way amid warnings of “widespread failures” in the travel sector in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
French mountains resorts closed at midnight on Saturday just hours after tens of thousands had landed for their annual holiday in the snow.
Leading ski and summer activity holiday company Neilson has called for the government to step in with “emergency measures”.
There were reports of chaos and confusion across the Alps with one source saying local police had taken the French government’s message into their own hands and going round hotels and restaurants telling marooned Britons to go home immediately.
Diane Palumbo, sales and marketing director at SkiWorld, said she had 900 customers across the Alps and they had been in talks with all the key resorts on Friday to warn them that if they were to close not to do so on Saturday when a fresh influx of tourists were scheduled to arrive.
“We are getting over our anger. It was literally not until 10pm last night that we were confident of the information we were receiving. The same people who had assured us on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday that they would remain open, have now all closed,” she said.
The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, announced that the country must “close all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops” from midnight.
Although ski-resorts were not specifically listed, the ski industry in the UK believe they are all closing.
One of the biggest operators, Inghams, said “as a responsible tour operator” it would not be operating any more holidays to French resorts for the rest of the season and advised those who were due to go out on Sunday to abandon plans.
Palumbo said all those who had booked through an ATOL backed agent would get their money back but that small- to medium-sized tour operators and travel companies could go bust.
“The airlines are very quick to ask for help from the government but this is a massive flow of people which will costs the industry millions. If the government does not step in travel companies will start to fail because the cost of repatriation will be enormous,” she said.
David Taylor, chief executive of Neilson holidays, said it was “hugely disappointed” that it received such short notice on the closures. He called for emergency measures for the sector.
With the Covid-19 crisis likely to last several months, we are asking the government to consider emergency measures specifically targeted at the travel and leisure sector to deliver immediate relief and help avoid widespread failures.
This remains an isolated issue on 2020 departures only and we are confident that next year will see a healthy recovery provided a swathe of relief measures recommended to the government are enacted.
Separately Ryanair was frantically working to repatriate customers stranded in Spain after the country was thrown into lockdown arrangements. It has also cancelled all flights to and from Poland.
“Ryanair Group Airlines (including Buzz and Lauda) has been forced to severely reduce flights to/from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from 24.00 Sun 15 Mar until 24.00 Thurs 19 Mar,” it said in a statement.
It added it was “contacting all affected customers by email to advise them of their options and we urge customs not to call us”.
Earlier, it announced all flights “to and from Poland have been cancelled from midnight on Saturday to midnight on 31 March”.

Health minister Nadine Dorries has reassured people panic-buying toilet roll that she has not run out of the bathroom essential during her week in self-isolation.
However, it was unclear how many rolls she had in her house when her period of quarantine began after she tested positive earlier this week. 
Having lived through #Coronavirus can I assure everyone that at no time during the seven days we were in isolation at home did we even once have to face a secondary crisis and run out of loo roll. 🧻
A piece authored by the novelist has been published n the Times (paywall) this morning, documenting the Tory MP’s coronavirus ordeal.
I will always remember how I felt the moment I was told that I had tested positive for the coronavirus — not least because it was the very last thing I was expecting to hear.
A diagnosis would make no difference to how I behaved or dealt with my symptoms. But I had my 84-year-old mother staying with me for a few weeks and, despite the fact that she has survived polio, rheumatic fever, major heart surgery and a world war, she is not in the best of health.
The community nursing team were waiting for me as I drove into a Covid-19 testing centre on a local industrial estate. It resembled the tyre-change bay at my local garage.
Unlike with my situation, we know exactly where [her mother] caught it from and the irony is, despite her having had major surgery to replace the valves in her heart damaged by childhood illness, despite her pacemaker and breathlessness, her lifetime of smoking, hard work in her early years and poor diet, she had much milder symptoms than me.

G7 leaders will discuss the importance of a coordinated response to the impact of coronavirus on the global economy, according to No 10 following a phone conversation between Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe.
A Downing Street spokesperson said:
The prime minister spoke to Japanese prime minister Abe about the coronavirus pandemic.
The leaders updated each other on their countries’ efforts to curb the spread of the virus. The prime minister stressed the importance the UK is placing on taking a science-led approach when deciding what measures to implement.
The prime minister and prime minister Abe agreed on the importance of international coordination to tackle the virus and its wider impact, particularly on the global economy, and they looked forward to the call between G7 leaders to discuss this.
The prime minster and prime minister Abe also discussed the UK and Japan’s efforts to combat climate change ahead of COP26 in Glasgow later this year.

Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government.
The Waqf at Masjid al-Aqsa has decided to temporarily close the Musallah al-Qibli, Dome of the Rock and all covered prayer areas at the mosque as a precautionary measure.

People in some states could face hefty fines if they do not comply with new government restrictions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, with the prime minister announcing strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days. 
Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus.
The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening.
A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman – a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge – died on Saturday.
NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57.
Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61.
Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people.
State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made.
Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against “static, non-essential” mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday, although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger “widescale” closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces.
“We will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,” Morrison said.
“All people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days.
“Further, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.”
Morrison said that – until now – self-isolation had been a “voluntary arrangement” with “no potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement”.
“That will change,” he said, although penalties would be “a matter for the states and territories”.
“If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.”
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state’s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made.
Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday’s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved.
But she said it would be difficult to monitor “every situation” and the government would be relying on “public goodwill” to ensure the rules were followed and the government would “prefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation”.
“If you’re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,” Berejiklian said.
The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000.
“To date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,” she said.
The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included “severe fines”, for people who breached the self-isolation rules.
By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing.
“The states and territories … are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.”
Morrison said the government’s national information campaign “is running and it will be available to all Australians” but claimed that social distancing was “pretty straightforward”.
He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean “ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they’re close family and friends”. “It’s all commonsense.”
For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them.
“If we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,” he said.
Morrison foreshadowed that there “will be further intrusions, further restrictions on people’s movement and their behaviour” in future in response to changes in medical advice.
The first of these will be new protocols for visiting aged care facilities, he said, with further work to be done to protect remote communities in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that school closures are regarded as inevitable, prompting many schools and universities to prepare for shutdowns.
But Morrison said there were “very good reasons” against moving to “broadscale closures of schools” at this point.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, schools should stay open at this time because taking children out may expose others to risk and would “put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community”, he said. “The states and territories are not moving in that direction.”
The issue will be revisited at meetings of the national cabinet on Tuesday and Friday, although individual schools in Victoria and NSW have been allowed to close “based on the cases presented there in the circumstances that exist in those communities”, he said.
Earlier on Sunday Murphy and the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that as advice changes, measures might escalate to include general lockdowns.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” Murphy told ABC’s Insiders. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
Labor has criticised the government for the slow pace of rolling out a national information campaign, and on Sunday the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for further support for the aviation sector, which missed out on funding in the $1bn regional and community fund.
“While these measures are necessary for public health, the federal government must urgently address the significant consequences for our aviation sector,” she said.
“With conditions changing rapidly and no end in sight, the federal government must urgently provide all necessary support to ensure Australia has a vibrant aviation sector once the coronavirus outbreak has passed.”"

People in some states could face hefty fines if they do not comply with new government restrictions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, with the prime minister announcing strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days. 
Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus.
The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening.
A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman – a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge – died on Saturday.
NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57.
Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61.
Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people.
State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made.
Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against “static, non-essential” mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday, although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger “widescale” closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces.
“We will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,” Morrison said.
“All people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days.
“Further, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.”
Morrison said that – until now – self-isolation had been a “voluntary arrangement” with “no potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement”.
“That will change,” he said, although penalties would be “a matter for the states and territories”.
“If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.”
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state’s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made.
Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday’s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved.
But she said it would be difficult to monitor “every situation” and the government would be relying on “public goodwill” to ensure the rules were followed and the government would “prefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation”.
“If you’re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,” Berejiklian said.
The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000.
“To date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,” she said.
The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included “severe fines”, for people who breached the self-isolation rules.
By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing.
“The states and territories … are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.”
Morrison said the government’s national information campaign “is running and it will be available to all Australians” but claimed that social distancing was “pretty straightforward”.
He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean “ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they’re close family and friends”. “It’s all commonsense.”
For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them.
“If we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,” he said.

","Scott Morrison says widespread closures ‘anti-intuitive’ as state cancels excursions, assemblies, concerts and travel• Coronavirus latest updates: all arrivals in Australia must self-isolate for 14 days, says PM
The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure.
“Schools have been a focus of the community and the government as the impacts of the coronavirus have developed globally,” Scott said.
“From Monday onwards I expect assemblies and substantial gatherings to be cancelled, along with all excursions.”
All interschool arts and sports events have also been cancelled.
But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said widespread school closures would not take place, despite a raft of other new measures to contain the spread of the virus.
Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great.
“People are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
“As the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate.
“When you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.”
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources.
Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown.
Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. 
The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said.
I have had repeated contacts from parents that school bathrooms have no soap. Also that the taps are spring loaded and have to held on with one hand while the other is under it. This makes it impossible to wash hands as directed. This is normal in school student bathrooms.
Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the “opportune public health decision” with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later.
“Given that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,” one source said.
Schools are expected to introduce new social distancing measures this week, including scrapping school assemblies, school plays and concerts and reducing interschool activities.
The senior vice-president of the NSW Teachers’ Federation, Amber Flohm, said teachers had the technology available to deliver online learning but many children could be disadvantaged if they didn’t have access to computers and the internet.
“We are not doctors, we’re teachers, and so the decision will be for them and the department of education will respond accordingly,” Flohm said.
“There will be an equity issue. I would argue a lot of kids don’t have laptops. Children might have mobile phones but if we’re talking about delivering the curriculum, significant resources would need to be provided for teachers and students.”
Flohm dismissed a claim by the Greens MP David Shoebridge that not all schools provided soap for children to wash their hands.
“It is my understanding that all public schools have soap and access to water in their bathrooms … that’s not what we have heard from teachers.”
The former Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps called for schools to be immediately shut down despite the disruption to medical personnel who would have to care for children.
Phelps, a Sydney GP, also said all children should be tested for a fever when arriving at school if schools are kept open.
“It’s inevitable in the middle of an uncontrolled epidemic that the schools will be closed,” Phelps said. “It’s just a matter of when.
“Unless the government has convincing evidence that the schools can safely be kept open, that should be now.”"

Schools will remain open nationally despite escalating government restrictions on other aspects of life such as travel due to the spread of the coronavirus, but new social distancing measures have been announced for schools in New South Wales.

Lily Kuo","As Covid-19 spreads worldwide, the people of Hubei explain how they dealt with the lockdown


Sun 15 Mar 2020 06.00 GMT


Last modified on Sun 15 Mar 2020 06.07 GMT


In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress.
As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health.
At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn’t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent.
Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better.
Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support.
There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day.
It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can’t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live.
By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups.
It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself.
Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don’t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious.
It’s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven’t been able to concentrate on my work. I don’t absorb what I’m reading. I’m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can’t help it.
I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing.
If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help. Take advantage of this time to care for yourself and your family.
I came home from Wuhan the day before the lockdown. Like most people, I didn’t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family.
I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted.
Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn’t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people’s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much.
I feel like I am a survivor. It’s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a “lock down” diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions. Seeing other people reply has let me know that I am not alone. Everyone is in this situation. I am not special.
I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure.
Talking with friends is also really important. On the night of 6 February [when the Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang died], I spent all night reading the news on Weibo and WeChat. Like me, my friends didn’t sleep. Every update someone saw, they would immediately share.
This was the hardest time for me. There’s no way to really deal with this except to remember it. Also, in late January when the outbreak first exploded … seeing all the messages online of people asking for help and the huge gap between what was being reported in the news and what was really happening also caused a lot of mental pressure.

The acid test of Trump's maverick leadership has come – can he save himself?

David Smith in Washington","The president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been ‘haphazard’, from a cascade of false statements to a public address that fueled anxiety


Sun 15 Mar 2020 06.00 GMT


With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America.
Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making.
Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens – household names in America – will provide “drive-thru” testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance.
This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing.
The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump’s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before.

The acid test of Trump’s maverick leadership has finally come.
His response so far has been “haphazard”, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “When you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.”
Trump’s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. His discomfort on this topic was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it.
“Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” he said. “I don’t know anything about it.”
Trump’s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.
Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a “Keep America Great Again” cap, boasting of his “natural ability” to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.
On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers’ estimation, an unmitigated disaster, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.
Then came Friday’s rose garden reset. Trump declared a national emergency that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.
His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.
“This day should be an inspiration to every American,” he said, “because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing an all-of-America approach.
“Mr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China … throughout this process, Mr President, you’ve put the health of America first.”
It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?
There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points – its biggest point gain ever.
Furthermore, the are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump’s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, said: “I think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China]. The rollout of the kits and the testing was a step backwards but now they seem to be getting their footing back.”
His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk
Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: “He gets mixed reviews. His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk. Where he got good reviews lies in the government’s overall approach.”
Whalen noted that California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship.
Newsom told reporters: “We had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: ‘We’re gonna do the right thing’ and ‘You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise’. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.”
Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November’s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting.
It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush’s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Whalen said: “The question is how does he handle this as on a personal level. For Bush, the problem with Katrina wasn’t the federal response but Bush not getting out of the plane, not showing the personal touch. Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he’d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief.
“The economy is his trump card at all times. There are people who say: ‘I may not care for the tweets or his bombastic bluster but I’m making money while he’s in office.’ But now people will get their monthly statement and ask: ‘What happened to 10% of my portfolio?’”"

With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America.
Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making.
Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens – household names in America – will provide “drive-thru” testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance.
This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing.

The French prime minister announced the closure of cafes, restaurants and all public places “non-essential” to public life, including cinemas and discos, from midnight on Saturday . Edouard Philippe said: “We must absolutely limit movement, meetings and contacts.” But he allowed food shops, tobacconists, banks and public transport to remain open.
French authorities also warned that widely used over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen the coronavirus, as the number of cases across the country jumped to 4,480. There have been 91 deaths, and France is one of several countries across Europe that have gone into lockdown.
Schools closed after final lessons last week, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home, where the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has warned they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus online. Authorities have banned gatherings of more than 100 people and shut down attractions including the Eiffel Tower, the palace of Versailles, the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay. In the Paris region, there will be no Sunday masses.
The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the evolution and spread of the virus was “rapid and real”, but added that about 98% of those who test positive for the virus do recover. 
Health officials point out that anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system. The health ministry added that patients should choose paracetamol because “it will reduce the fever without counter-attacking the inflammation”. Kim Willsher
The number of imported coronavirus cases now exceeds locally transmitted new infections for the first time, data from China’s national health commission shows. On Friday it had 11 new cases, but seven were brought in by travellers from the US, Italy and Saudi Arabia, and only four were transmitted inside the country. At least one of these was a US-based Chinese citizen, who reportedly returned home in search of medical treatment after requests for a test were turned down in Massachusetts, where she lived.
Beijing has been providing free treatment as part of its effort to halt the spread of the virus. But apparently in anticipation of more people arriving from abroad with the disease, it has drawn up a policy that will require most to pay for their own care. Emma Graham-Harrison
The Spanish government declared a state of emergency on Saturday, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to leave their homes only if they needed to buy food, medicine, or go to work or hospital.
The lockdown, which will begin on Monday, comes after schools across the country were closed for a fortnight and the regional governments of Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias ordered the closure of all non-essential shops. The only businesses permitted to remain open are supermarkets, bakeries, butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers, petrol stations, pharmacies, tobacconists and newspaper kiosks.
Madrid’s city council announced the closure of all public parks and gardens to prevent large concentrations of people, while Seville, Granada and Córdoba cancelled their Holy Week celebrations. The Catalan president, Quim Torra, announced plans to close off the north-eastern region and called on the central government to assist by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways.
After Italy, Spain is the European country most affected by the coronavirus, and has confirmed 6,391 cases and 196 deaths.
Jet2, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, Málaga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.
The socialist-led government of prime minister Pedro Sánchez, whose wife tested positive for Covid-19 last night, has been fiercely criticised for its delay in rolling out robust measures to fight the virus and for allowing huge rallies across the country last Sunday to mark International Women’s Day. A state of emergency has not been declared since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers’ strike. It will initially apply for two weeks. Sam Jones
Fears are growing about the spread of the virus in the world’s second-most populous country after it recorded its second death.
India has an impressive record in tackling infectious diseases, including defeating polio, and in 2009 curbing the swine flu pandemic. But it also has a stretched and uneven public health system.
The latest victim, a 68-year-old woman, caught the virus from her son after he travelled to Italy and Switzerland. He works at a large plant and may have been in contact with up to 1,500 people.
With 102 cases confirmed, the New Delhi government has invoked the Epidemic Act, which allows authorities to force people into isolation, and has brought in laws to prevent hoarding of hand sanitisers.
In many states, social life is being curbed, with gyms, pools, cinemas and theatres closed, and weddings, engagements and birthday parties banned in southern Karnataka. Emma Graham-Harrison "

There has been a huge difference in how the coronavirus pandemic has evolved in different countries. Some have gone nearly two months with just a few dozen cases; others have seen an outbreak explode in weeks.
The statistics about the early evolution of cases can be confusing, because some countries were slow to test or late to announce results. Italy’s first case was at the end of January, but the disease is thought to have been circulating there from the middle of the month. Likewise the steep rise of cases in Iran suggests it was spreading long before the first positive test.
Many of the countries that have had the greatest success in containing the disease are ones that were affected by Sars in 2002-03. The memory of that crisis may have led to better preparedness, in government and among the population, and to a greater willingness among people to comply with restrictions on movement and daily life to prevent the spread of infection.
There are three main aspects to controls that aim to stop the spread of the disease. The first is travel bans on people from areas with high levels of cases (initially mainland China, now many more places); the second is quarantine rules to prevent known or suspected carriers from spreading infection; and the third is shutdowns and social distancing to prevent transmission between unidentified carriers by reducing human contact.
Below we take a look at some of the worst-affected countries, and the most successful at containing coronavirus so far. China has not been included, because its circumstances are an outlier. But it is another example of how quarantine requirements, and strict controls on movement and social interaction, can dramatically curb the spread of the disease. On Friday it had only eight new cases, the first time that number has fallen into single digits since the outbreak began.
Initially, Italy did little to stop the spread of coronavirus. After it registered more deaths than any other country outside China, and the scale of the crisis became clear, it locked down first the northern region at the centre of the crisis and then the entire country.
Schools and universities have closed, along with all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies. Restaurants and bars are closed to customers, although they can make home deliveries. Sports events and outdoor gatherings are banned.
Permission is required if travel is vital for medical, work or personal reasons.
After announcing the first cases (and deaths) in late February, Iran did nothing about coronavirus – perhaps because the government felt it could not afford to offend China, a vital partner for the isolated country. Flights between Iran and China continued, and Iran donated a million face masks to China. Even after the toll began to rise rapidly, and senior politicians tested positive, health workers in small hospitals did not initially use protective gear.
Now schools have been closed and most Friday prayer services are cancelled. People have been urged to self-isolate, and the government has warned it may use force to prevent internal travel. The country has dug mass graves to bury the dead.
The country’s most important tool in fighting coronavirus has been its testing system; South Korea has run far more tests per capita than any other country – and nearly 10 times more than in the UK.
Many of those tested are members of the Shincheonji religious sect, whose members in Daegu city account for more than half of cases. There are 53 drive-through testing stations, allowing people to check their illness without physical contact.
Other measures include cancelling major events, and asking people to stay away from Daegu. The start of a new school term has been delayed from 2 March to the 22nd. Emergency childcare in classes of no more than 10 is offered for those who must go to work. Home working has been encouraged, with subsidies for companies that offer employees the flexibility to manage new care responsibilities.
GPS maps, available online to the public, track the movements of anyone confirmed to have the virus. South Korea also screens passengers leaving the country.
Widespread testing meant a jump in confirmed cases, currently more than 7,800, but resulted in a very low mortality rate, below 1%. New daily cases are down from a peak two weeks ago, and on Friday the country reported more recoveries than new cases, for the first time since the outbreak began.
Despite its closeness to China, physically and in economic terms, Taiwan has had extraordinary success in controlling the coronavirus. Efforts may have been helped by the Sars experience, and the fact that the vice-president is an epidemiologist.
Taiwan was probably the first country to try to stop coronavirus spreading, bringing in checks on travellers from Wuhan at the end of December, after reports of a mystery, pneumonia-like illness.
A command centre for epidemics kicked into action in late January, producing new policies and monitoring virus-tracking and treatment efforts. Wider travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were introduced despite the insistence of the World Health Organization (WHO) that they were not necessary. Extensive testing and contact-tracing through the public health system prevented the disease spreading.
School holidays were extended during late February, and schools can be closed again if cases emerge among students.
Travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were put in place, going beyond WHO advice. An exhaustive testing regime covered anyone with flu-like or pneumonia symptoms. All possible contacts of those infected were tracked, involving the police, flight manifests and a local test for antibodies that circulate after an infection clears.
Tests are free, and a huge public information campaign has urged even people with mild symptoms to see a doctor. The government covers medical bills for suspected or confirmed cases, so there are no financial risks to getting tested.
Self-employed people get a quarantine allowance, and employers are banned from deducting days in isolation from annual leave.
Measures can also be punitive, with one couple prosecuted for providing false travel history.
Most border crossings with mainland China have been closed, and people arriving from there must quarantine for 14 days.
Schools and universities closed in mid-January, and most remain shut, although a few private schools have partly reopened. Working from home has been encouraged where possible. Museums and sports facilities are shut, and people told to avoid large gatherings.
Those with strong memories of Sars have voluntarily stayed home when they can, and used masks and hand sanitiser when they have to go out.
The measures have also brought a drop in seasonal flu cases."

Coronavirus quarantine and self-isolation: your questions answered

Sarah Boseley Health Editor, and 
Martin Belam","What is the voluntary quarantine advice for people returning from areas affected by the new coronavirus if they start feeling unwell?


Tue 3 Mar 2020 09.40 GMT


First published on Thu 27 Feb 2020 17.56 GMT


Health authorities are advising that people returning from areas affected by the new coronavirus should self-isolate.
Self-isolation is a sort of voluntary quarantine, where people have to make their own arrangements.
They are expected to stay at home, and certainly not go to work or college. It has been described by public health officials as taking the same measures you would if you had a heavy cold – although perhaps the better comparison would be the flu.
The key thing is not to go near other people, to avoid spreading the virus, which is transmitted via droplets from coughs and sneezes. It is thought you need to be relatively close to inhale those droplets – maybe within a metre or so. But the droplets can also land on surfaces and transfer to people’s hands – hence the advice to wash them frequently.
At first, some officials suggested it would do no harm to go to the shops, assuming people keep their distance from others. But more recently they have been advising people to arrange food deliveries to their homes.
The virus is most likely to be transmitted at close quarters, to family members. Those people will be at risk in any circumstances if one of the family is infected.
If people are returning to family from an affected area, the others may want to keep their distance as much as they can – or self-isolate as well.
It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.
In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:
More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.
China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.
As of 9 March, more than 110,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have over 3,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. 62,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.
We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.
Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.
Sarah Boseley, Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam
They should not go to a doctor’s surgery or medical facility, where they risk infecting other people, some of whom may be very vulnerable because they have health problems. They should stay home and call for advice. In the UK they should use the NHS 111 number.
These are voluntary measures and they cannot be compelled. Authorities have imposed stricter quarantine conditions on people known to have been exposed to high-risk situations."

Robin McKie
What is the best way to strengthen the immune system?
The answer to this question is straightforward: the normal approach to healthy living. Have a balanced diet, try to get as much sleep as you can, exercise, don’t overwork. If you smoke, try to give up and reduce your intake of alcohol and other drugs.
Are alcohol-based antibacterial gels useful?
Washing your hands regularly with soap and water or alcohol-based gels, whether they say “antibacterial” on them or not, is the best way to prevent Covid-19. They also have the other advantage of helping to stop you pick up other infections that could weaken your immune system and so make you more susceptible to Covid-19.
What underlying conditions pose the biggest risk if you contract the virus? 
The first thing to note is that most of the data we have about Covid-19 is from China. These indicate that heart disease, followed by diabetes, hypertension – high blood pressure – chronic lung disease and finally some cancers were the main risk factors.
The more of these conditions you have, the greater the likelihood of severe disease that you face. Certainly, people with these conditions or older people should keep taking their usual prescribed medicines, be extra vigilant, including in handwashing, and should consider what is called social distancing, which means avoiding crowds or in some cases visitors.
How long does the disease survive in the air and on surfaces?
The coronavirus can persist in the air for a few hours and on some surfaces for quite lengthy periods – on cardboard for a day, on plastic two or three days. Disinfectants such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite work really well and will get rid of the virus. So regardless of how long they persist on household surfaces, as long as we keep those surfaces clean we will control the virus.
How do hospitals treat people admitted with coronavirus?
If people are not that unwell we might give fluids or oxygen, for example. And if someone had a pneumonia infection on top of Covid-19, they’d be given antibiotics. We might also use the antiviral Tamiflu – not to tackle the coronavirus but to treat flu a patient might additionally have picked up. We may also consider painkillers and anti-cough medicine.
For the few who become more seriously ill, we would consider mechanical ventilation, in which a tube is passed down the airway to help patient breathe. I can’t stress enough though, regardless of how sick a patient is, the importance of good nursing care, compassion, and empathy in supporting and caring for people with Covid-19.
What do you think the death rate from coronavirus will be?
It will vary from country to country. In the UK, I think a figure of 1% is probably going to be correct but we will have to wait until the epidemic is over. What is clear is that the death rate in younger people and those without any other illnesses looks to be very low.
What kind of immunity will a person have once they have been infected?
Other coronaviruses such as Mers and Sars have shown you get some immunity once you have been infected. Just how much or how long it will last we do not know. We will gather that data as events develop. I have seen no good data to suggest a person can get Covid-19 twice.
Is it realistic to hope for a vaccine for Covid-19 this year?
I doubt a vaccine will be available in the UK in time to prevent the curve of cases going up. However if it becomes a seasonal illness then developing a vaccine will be crucial – and adapting that vaccine to new coronavirus strains will also be extremely valuable. "

Amid a global pandemic, Hong Kong’s famously crowded streets are eerily quiet. Most of the city’s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months.
Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution.
It’s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises.
In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people.
It’s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong’s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died.
After a rocky start, the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive – schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings.
There is tentative talk that containment efforts are working and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong’s authorities.
The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region’s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government’s classification of protesters as “rioters”.
Only one of the movement’s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns.
“I think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,” says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement.
“Question one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.”
Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong’s sociology department, says the protests “lost steam”, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with the traumatic university sieges and the success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections.
Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to “warrior style disobedience” – short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement.
A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets.
“To us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital. But when it comes to seeing our home being destroyed by tyranny in every way possible, values we have been upholding are twisted and devastated, the virus seems too minor an issue to hinder us from guarding our home,” she says.
“We will never back off. We are willing to do everything to fight against injustice and expose the truth even if our efforts seemed small and powerless.”
There is widespread acceptance that the fear of infection at mass gatherings has played a part in the diminished numbers.
However it has also driven its own protests.
The already low support and trust in the Hong Kong government and chief executive, Carrie Lam, were compounded by early missteps in responding to the virus.
“The wrong and inefficient allocation of resources [eg masks] and slow border closures incited hatred in our community too,” the administrator says, in reference to protests and strikes over Lam’s reluctance to close borders or place restrictions on travellers from mainland China.
“If the government had closed the border, we could have been able to stop the epidemic spreading in Hong Kong even more effectively.”
Kong says the policing of protests during the outbreak has been “more oppressive than ever”.
Alleged police brutality and mass arrests continue, including three high-profile pro-democracy figures on charges which observers said could apply to almost any protester, as well as hundreds of others at smaller events since.
Last Sunday, police were filmed pepper-spraying journalists and bystanders at a demonstration against the establishment of a Covid-19 clinic in a high-density residential area. Just hours later they were again accused of excessive force in trying to shut down a vigil for a young man who died when he fell from a car park during a protest in November.
On Wednesday the US State Department accused the Hong Kong government of an “apparent unwillingness to criticise the police force” or investigate alleged breaches of civil liberties. Hong Kong dismissed the report as foreign interference.
Albert Ho, a solicitor and high-profile pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, says it is clear there have been fewer confrontations and clashes since the virus, and authorities appear to be using the quiet time to round up key figures and organisers.
“I think they have come to a stage where they can say they have clamped down on these movements by the youngsters,” he says.
“So they have to do everything to deter the social organisers from continuing to organise marches and demonstrations on a big scale.”
Views differ within the movement on whether another organised, police-approved rally could draw people out in their millions again.
Junker says it looks like the movement is now trying to re-energise, but there’s “a lot of fatalism at this point, saying nothing is working”.
“The government has all the resources and institutional levers to follow up in these retributional ways.”
But it’s hard to predict.
“It’s like a weird kind of effervescent chemistry where [if] the right things converge and boom, you have two million people out on the street.”
Kong says: “One thing is certain – distrust and anger with the government has only grown, and people’s views haven’t changed: we’re sick of an unrepresentative and unresponsive government. We want democracy. How that manifests itself is hard to say.”"

'Sledgehammer on Trump, scalpel on Sanders': Biden approaches key debate

Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will square off in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night, in a contest moved from Arizona to Washington DC and held without a live audience due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The escalating public health crisis has played havoc with all areas of US life, but Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio will still go to the polls on Tuesday.
After his spectacular rebound on Super Tuesday and strong performances this week, Biden is ahead in delegates earned, seemingly on course for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November.
But Sanders has refused to throw in the towel, saying this week that though he may be “losing the debate over electability”, he is a champion for the views of most younger voters and wants to influence the general election platform.
“On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,” Sanders said, indicating he would challenge the former vice-president on healthcare reform, the minimum wage and other progressive priorities.
Nick Carter, Sanders’ political outreach director in 2016, told the New York Times the Vermont senator was “pivoting to ensure that the issues that he has built his political career around continue to be front and center in the political dialogue.
“I also think he has [at the] top of [his] mind ensuring his supporters and those unenthusiastic about a Biden candidacy don’t call it a day.”
Many in the Democratic establishment would prefer the independent from Vermont admit defeat and put his shoulder to the wheel for Biden.
In emails to the Guardian, Martin O’Malley, a former Baltimore mayor, Maryland governor and candidate for the presidential nomination, said he was “guessing, most kindly, that Bernie is thinking as quickly as Biden sprung back to political life, he could as easily stumble and so he has an obligation to hang in there.
“What he risks is that more and more people [see] his messiah veneer fall away and his hypocrisy on many issues – gun safety, immigration reform, Russia interference – will strip away his lovable old uncle persona.”
At the polls, Biden’s comeback from seemingly inevitable defeat has been powered by older voters, moderates, voters in swing counties and an overwhelming percentage of African Americans.
“I think Biden has been so battered and scarred already,” O’Malley said, “[that] I’m not sure there is much more that Bernie can do … in fact, Bernie could be a useful foil for Biden’s need to appeal to and win more independents.”
Reed Galen, a former aide to George W Bush and John McCain, left the Republican party in 2016 and is now part of the Lincoln Project, a super Pac devoted to producing ads against Trump.
Sanders is “using the core of his support base to not drop out gracefully”, Galen told the Guardian on Saturday, adding: “I don’t think Bernie Sanders has grace about him. From my perspective I think he should have [dropped out] and let the Biden campaign go and do the things it needs to do vis-a-vis Trump.
“But Bernie doesn’t care because he’s not a Democrat and never has been, so from his supporters’ perspective, if they wreck the Democratic party it’s just another win for them.”
Galen and O’Malley both expected a fiery contest in CNN’s Washington studio.
“Biden won’t stand there like a punching bag,” said O’Malley, who experienced the highs and lows of the debate stage alongside Sanders and Hillary Clinton. “He will hit back when pressed. And Bernie has no choice but to press.”
Galen said he thought Biden had a good opportunity to appeal again to moderates and independents, but added a warning about the pitfalls of any such bare-knuckle political bout, into which Biden has fallen in this and other elections.
“When you hit that debate stage it’s like a roller coaster heading downhill,” he said. “You hope it’s going to stay on the tracks but once in a while it goes flying off the edge.”
The coronavirus outbreak – which caused Univision host Jorge Ramos to step aside as a debate host after contact with someone exposed to Covid-19 – seems sure to dominate proceedings.
Both Biden and Sanders addressed the nation on the subject this week, attempting to present a contrast with Trump’s wildly uneven attempts to lead.
Galen said he thought Biden’s advisers would therefore seek to “utilise what Biden has been best at, which is relying on personal experience.
“We saw this week that he started talking about what he’s done in government and what government can and can’t do. I think his team will try to stay in that fairly narrow zone.
“But it wouldn’t surprise me if they also spend a fair amount of time focused on Trump. Here’s a way that he can use a sledgehammer on Trump but a scalpel on Sanders: by saying, ‘Here’s a guy we elected that had no experience, no people willing to work for him, no people he is willing to listen to. We can’t have that anymore.’”
Galen and O’Malley both deplored a tweet sent by Trump’s campaign this week which called Biden a “rotting corpse of a candidate”, and said it was a taste of the fierce and dirty fight to come.
“There is one question and only one question that viewers will be asking themselves during Sunday’s debate,” O’Malley said, “and it is this: which of these two candidates would do the best job of keeping me and my family safe in a big emergency, like, a pandemic.
“What I do know is that of the three men left [including Trump], more and more people are wishing Biden were already in charge.”
In fact, the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still campaigning. For the debate in Washington on Sunday, however, she did not meet qualification criteria set by the Democratic National Committee."

Georgia second US state to delay presidential primaries over coronavirus fears
",Coronavirus – latest updates," Georgia, where Joe Biden is ahead of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race, joins Louisiana in pushing back voting as Covid-19 spreads

Georgia has become the second state to delay its presidential primaries over coronavirus fears, a day after Louisiana also pushed back voting in primaries.
In-person early voting, which began statewide 2 March, will be halted and the election that was scheduled for 24 March will be moved to 19 May, when Georgia’s other 2020 primary elections are being held, Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger said in a statement on Saturday.
In addition to public safety, one of the biggest considerations was the risk the virus posed to poll workers, who are often older, election officials said.
“Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, and the community at large,” Raffensperger said.
It came after Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, signed an emergency declaration that unlocked sweeping powers to fight Covid-19. In a speech on Saturday, the governor renewed a call for places of worship, schools and others to consider canceling large gatherings as cases in the state rise.
On Friday, Louisiana became the first state to postpone its presidential primaries due to the virus.
As of Saturday, the virus had infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,800. The death toll in the US rose to 51 with more than 2,100 infections, as Donald Trump expanded a ban on travel from Europe by adding Britain and Ireland to the list.
Georgia is reporting 66 confirmed cases, with most concentrated around Atlanta. One death in the state has been attributed to the virus.
Cobb County elections director Janine Eveler said in an interview Saturday evening that her heavily populated Atlanta county had seen “a little over 100” poll workers quit in recent days because of fears over the virus.
“Each day we had more and more poll workers wanting to bow out due to concern over their health,” Eveler said, adding that she believed the decision to postpone the election was the right one.
Only one candidate is on the Republican ballot in Georgia for the presidential primary: Trump.
The Democratic race has been narrowed to a two-man matchup between former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Biden has been leading Sanders in key Georgia demographics such as African Americans and suburban voters and has been endorsed by a slew of state and local officials.
Raffensperger’s office said that the decision to postpone the election was made in consultation with the state Democratic and Republican parties.
“Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all Georgians and to ensure that as many people as possible have an opportunity to vote,” state senator Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic party of Georgia said, according to the statement. “Continued in-person voting could compromise both goals.”
All votes already cast, including in-person and absentee ballots, will be counted. As of Thursday, 224,000 voters had already cast ballots in the primary, according to Associated Press elections research.
The delayed election is the latest in a long list of disruptions to ordinary life the virus has caused.
School districts covering the majority of Georgia’s 1.8 million public school students have announced closures. Among many events postponed or canceled are the NCAA final four basketball tournament in Atlanta, Savannah’s St Patrick’s Day parade and the Masters golf tournament in Augusta."

After the share market fell 7.4% on Monday, 3.5% on Wednesday, and more than 5% on Thursday you could be excused for thinking everything is buggered.
Do we need perspective? The market is around 23% below the peak of the past 12 months, which is much less a fall than in the October 1987 crash, and also the global financial crisis. In both cases the stock market lost about half of its value.
So that’s the good news.
The bad news is, oh boy, it can fall a lot more yet.
Yes, the long-term performance of the stock market is good – a 6.2% annual return over 35 years. But these hits take time to recover from.
It took around eight years to return to the pre-1987 crash peaks, and 11 years after the GFC.
That does not mean all our super is gone. This year will be carnage, but over the past 10 years the median annual rate of return for industry super funds has been 8% (for retail funds it is 6.3%).
The problem of course is what if those were the good times? Perspective is great only if normality returns.
The current national advice is to get tested if you:
The national coronavirus health information hotline is 1800 020 080.The federal health department has a coronavirus health alert website. 
The state health department websites and contact numbers are:
A 2006 Treasury department paper on “The macroeconomic effect of an influenza pandemic”, coincidentally co-authored by the current Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, concludes that “GDP could contract by over 5% over the first year following an outbreak of a highly contagious pandemic”.
But such a study did not consider that the world’s biggest economy is run by a megalomaniac with an aversion to reality. Consider that Trump gave a national TV address in which he stated at least three errors, all of which sent the US markets into their biggest fall for 33 years.
The lack of any international co-ordination is damning – no urgent meeting of the G20, not even a phone hook-up.
Trump has made the world more insular, at the very moment it needs to be the opposite.
And what about our government’s response?
It has been less than stellar.
The lack of a public information campaign is damning. Where are the health advice ads playing on TV? They haven’t been able to even get a cheap YouTube ad up to share on social media.
Should you get tested? How do you get tested? When should you stay home?
We should all know the advice by rote.
The economic stimulus, I think, also contains far too little on the health side.
During the GFC we needed to get people spending; now we first need to ensure it is safe for people to go out to spend.
An absolute priority must be to ensure people who are sick stay home. I would have considered providing casual workers with at least access to a 14-day government-paid sick leave equal to the minimum wage for coronavirus symptoms.
In such cases you need to go big to break through the noise. Nothing in the government’s announcement had you thinking “cripes, they aren’t holding back”. Mostly the reaction was instead was that more is needed.
The level of resources being put towards urgent and rapid testing should be jaw-dropping.
Instead, we had Morrison being grossly casual telling Alan Jones he is going to the footy and that “it’s important for our economy and just our general wellbeing ... that people sort of get on about their lives”.
At the same time the head of the AMA in Western Australia tweeted: “You want to go to the footy? I want my colleagues to stay alive. Cancel crowds at events. Close the schools soon.”
Later chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised that Coag recommended gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled (though not actually banned). Oddly that advice only comes into effect from Monday. I guess the virus gets the weekend off ...
Morrison’s TV address contained little health advice except “please visit health.gov.au or talk to your local GP” (because yes, GPs have so much time on their hands). He did not even address panic buying.
The $750 cash payment for government benefit cardholders also seems rather weak.
In 2008 the Rudd government’s first cash stimulus was $1,000 to $1,400 for pensioners and low-income households. It was followed up with $900 to households earning up to $80,000.
In 2008, $1,000 was worth 77% of average male weekly full-time earnings; $750 is just 40% of the current average of $1,840.
Crucially, the GFC payments did not have to account for people overspending while stocking up on supplies.
You would be smart to bet that the May budget will contain more than has been announced this week. I suspect we will need something even before then.

The UFC’s defiance of the coronavirus outbreak is reckless and irresponsible

In the wake of the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus 2019 a pandemic on Wednesday, major sports leagues in the United States and across the globe have reacted by canceling or postponing events. The NCAA canceled March Madness. MLB called off spring training and delayed the season, the PGA Tour canceled events, while the MLS, NHL and NBA have suspended their upcoming seasons until further notice. Yet despite the slew of professional organizations taking action to protect public health and safety, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, has no intention of deviating from its upcoming schedule and has instead decided to move some of its shows to Las Vegas.
As the coronavirus – officially known as Covid-19 – spreads across the United States, a growing number of states have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak, which allows states the authority to establish curfews, shut down public spaces, and a host of other restrictions. Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since announced that those shows (28 March 28 in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC’s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC’s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans.
The UFC also revealed that Saturday’s show in Brasilia, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city’s governor declared a ban on large gatherings. However, it appears that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission – the regulatory body responsible for fighter safety – was not intending on testing fighters for COVID-19, a troubling development given the contagious and unpredictable nature of the virus.
Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which is a virus related to Sars. The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control.
As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths.
Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks. These include practicing respiratory hygiene, social distancing and staying away from large-scale public gatherings. While sports organizations have interpreted this as an ethical obligation to suspend their seasons and cancel events, the UFC has no intention of canceling any upcoming shows.
“I talked to the president and the vice president about this, and they’re taking this very serious,” UFC president Dana White said during an appearance on ESPN’s SportsCenter on Thursday. “They’re saying, ‘Be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking.’ Everybody is panicking, and instead of panicking, we’re actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how to keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.”
White added that the UFC plans to screen incoming fans with “infrared technology” that would detect spikes in body temperatures such as those caused by fever. However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump’s response to the pandemic, which has been heavily criticized for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the longstanding friendship between Trump and White, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president’s blundered response to the outbreak.
It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows. Euro-African promotion ARES FC postponed an upcoming event in Belgium. ONE Championship followed suit and postponed its 20 March show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after hosting its previous event in Singapore behind closed doors. Combate Americas announced a “proactive plan” that included postponing upcoming shows and scheduling new ones on a closed-set TV studio, while Bellator postponed its Friday show hours before the event was set to begin.
Interestingly, White and the UFC have failed to address the status of UFC 249: Khabib v Ferguson, which is still scheduled to take place on April 18th at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. New York State governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York state last Saturday and has since placed a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city on Thursday and revealed that locations such as the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden could be closed for months to deal with what “could easily be a six-month crisis.” While the UFC will likely move its anticipated pay-per-piew event from Brooklyn to the Apex facility, it remains to be seen whether that will serve as a long-term solution for the promotion, especially given that Nevada has also declared a state of emergency.
White’s reaction to the outbreak over this past week, which includes the claim that he doesn’t “give a shit about the coronavirus”, suggests that the UFC will continue to push ahead with their planned events irrespective of concerns regarding public safety. During a time of crisis, the UFC’s stubborn insistence that the show must go on is not only a prime example of corporate greed but a betrayal of its responsibility towards its staff, its fighters and the public at large.
“This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a media briefing declaring Covid-19 a pandemic. “So every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.”"

Let’s start with what Malcolm Turnbull might call a penetrating glimpse of the obvious. The coronavirus pandemic looms as a global test.
This illness will test the efficacy of health systems and the competence of governments, their medical advisers, and major institutions. It will also test the civic responsibility of human populations.
This pandemic is a test for facts and evidence. The challenge of coronavirus has arrived in a post-truth age, and I suspect we are going to discover over the coming weeks and months whether experts and evidence still possess the gravitational force to anchor important conversations – or whether allegiance to tribe, coupled with the ceaseless noise of our hyper-connected societies, ultimately supplants truth.
McKay Coppins, who writes perceptively about American politics for the Atlantic, noted this week Donald Trump seemed determined, from the moment the virus reached the United States, “to construct an alternate reality around the outbreak”.
The Coppins piece was published before the Oval Office madness of Thursday, when Trump sent global markets tumbling when he seemed to blame the European Union for spreading a “foreign disease”, but that doesn’t matter, because Thursday’s behaviour is part of a continuum. The core of the Trump insurgency is weaponising mass distraction.
Coppins noted Trump has the instincts of an autocrat, but he uses different methods. Instead of silencing experts, or censoring the free media to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis, Trump “can simply use his presidential bullhorn to drown it out”. Unleashing a barrage of incoherence is intended “to bombard people with so many contradictory claims, conspiracy theories, what-abouts and distortions that they simply throw up their hands in confusion and exhaustion”.
Deconstructing Trump in this way is not a new insight. Steve Bannon, once chief strategist for Trump, called this core methodology “flooding the zone with shit”.
David Roberts at Vox has been arguing since 2017 that America is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, “a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know – what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening”. Roberts says American conservatives have triggered this rupture by rejecting the institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge, from scientists to journalists.
The new question Coppins posed was whether Trump’s methodology of sowing strategic doubt would continue to be a winner for him once his inveterate myth-making intersects with a rapidly escalating pandemic within his own borders.
During a pandemic, people get ill, people die, essential services get disrupted, and the economy wobbles. People suffer if their leaders are feckless or amoral. Perhaps more in hope than in certainty, Coppins wondered whether flooding the zone with shit, and being seen to do that, works when “the dangers are more tangible and immediate to voters, regardless of whether they support Trump”.
Implicit in this musing is a big question: will coronavirus trigger an inflection point when alternative reality, the currency of modern day demagogues, finally implodes in the face of lived reality, allowing the whole system to reset itself?
I reckon it’s the right question to ask, but I don’t know the answer, and to borrow from Lana Del Ray, hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have.
Let’s bail out of the insanity of the Trumpiverse and come home now. I said this week, after Scott Morrison unveiled his $17bn stimulus package, that evidence and expertise has staged something of a comeback. The battered technocrats, the maligned experts in Australia’s bureaucratic and political class, have hoisted themselves off the mat and appear to be exerting some influence.
Consider just one example. It is truly remarkable that in the space of a week, two at most, the Coalition executed a complete about-face on stimulus. You could easily miss it in the noise, but the Morrison government has now signed up to methods of pump-priming the economy that Liberals have spent more than a decade pillorying.
One senses Morrison’s hard-wired political pragmatism and the steady hand of Treasury in this gear shift (government people report the new secretary, Steven Kennedy, has been a source of rapid and reliable advice) but this must be beyond galling for Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan, who copped the decade-long blast for doing a version of what Morrison announced this week.
Lest I sound inexplicably upbeat this weekend, let me be clear. I haven’t fallen into a rapture about sanity suddenly resuming transmission in Canberra after a dispiriting interregnum.
We are a long way from that.
When it comes to the government’s management of the coronavirus, I have a bunch of practical questions. Is this stimulus large enough? Will it be rolled out quickly enough? Will people spend their handouts?
On the health side: was Morrison too slow on mass gatherings, and has this lack of urgency posed unacceptable public health risks? (Plenty of serious experts with medical training seem to think so, although the prime minister seems to be following the advice of his own highly reputable experts).
There was also one of those silly and counterproductive episodes that, in the age of rolling instant referendums, snowball, and become emblematic. There was the parable of the football match.
At the Council of Australian Governments meeting on Friday, Morrison pointed to the imminent necessity of cancelling large gatherings while saying in the same breath that he intended to go to an NRL game on Saturday night to watch his “beloved Sharkies” – plans he had to walk back once Peter Dutton revealed he had become infected with coronavirus.
It would have been better for Morrison to pull out on Friday afternoon to be consistent with where his own health advice was trending. But instead of ejecting elegantly, through a prism of considered leadership, there was an inelegant dismount late in the evening, and a mildly churlish statement from the office saying the prime minister had cancelled because of the “potential for the prime minister’s attendance to be misrepresented”. It wasn’t really clear by whom.
Related to this: I get that pandemics are fast moving, and complex to manage, but why is the messaging sometimes clear and sometimes confusing and seemingly contradictory, and could somebody perhaps fine tune that?
I suspect it might be better if the government started mapping out where things are likely to head to help prepare people for what’s just over the horizon, because as it stands now, some days it looks like advice is no sooner given than it is overtaken by new advice. Recent days have demonstrated messaging can be both clear and confounding, particularly in rapidly changing conditions. Also: where is the necessary public education campaign? That really does seem urgent.
So it should be clear that I am not saying the government delivered a stimulus package that wasn’t stupid, so everything is OK now. The only observation I’m making is the official coronavirus-related conversations in Australia are certainly contested, but they are occurring within the boundaries of expert advice, and what you might term shared reality. At least so far.
I really welcome that. We all should welcome that.
Unfortunately, a number of other conversations in daily political life under this government remain stubbornly outside that frame, and that general tendency undermines Morrison’s current efforts to project as a prime minister whose information can be trusted.
Climate change is the obvious one. Can anyone tell me why Morrison can be counselled by experts with scientific training in managing a pandemic – and be seen to be doing that – yet ignore equally valid expert advice about another existential risk? I’d really love to know.
The other obvious one is the sports grants fiasco. Morrison is point-blank refusing to engage with evidence that shows his office was a hands-on decision maker in at least one of the adjudications about sports grants, which runs counter to the narrative he’s constructed where Bridget McKenzie was the decision maker.
Morrison is also stepping around the central unresolved question about whether his government acted lawfully in allocating these grants. The prime minister steps around this inconvenience by either declining to take questions, or taking the questions and then declining to answer them.
Given this is all pretty depressing, let me leave you with one cheery thought.
The optimist in me says this week’s stimulus about-face example demonstrates that this government can turn on the head of a dime; that the opposite can also be true, if the time has come for the opposite to also be true.
Think of it this way. If the Coalition can spend a decade defaming Labor for the crime of stimulating the economy to ward off a recession, and then follow Labor’s playbook during a close encounter with an economic crisis on their own watch – then anything can happen.
Anything, truly. A serious shift on climate change. True confessions on sports grants. Both unlikely, but in high octane times such as these, it’s best never to leave your desk."

","What initially seemed localised is worldwide and economic pain will go on for longer than first thought
Travel bans. Sporting events cancelled. Mass gatherings prohibited. Stock markets in freefall. Deserted shopping malls. Get ready for the Covid-19 global recession.
Up until a month ago this seemed far-fetched. It was assumed that the coronavirus outbreak would be a localised problem for China and that any spillover effects to the rest of the world could be comfortably managed by a bit of policy easing by central banks.
When it became clear that Covid-19 was not confined to China and that the economic effects would be more widespread, forecasts started to be revised down. But central banks, finance ministries and independent economists took comfort from the fact that there would be a sharp but short hit to activity followed by a rapid return to business as usual.
This line of thinking has exact parallels with the events of 2007, when it was initially assumed that the subprime mortgage crisis was a minor and manageable problem affecting only the US – and nobody needs reminding how that ended.
If history is any guide, the global economy will eventually recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, but the idea that this is going to be a V-shaped recession in the first half of 2020 followed by a recovery in the second half of the year looks absurd after the tumultuous events of the past week.
What’s more, policymakers know as much. The Federal Reserve – the US central bank – does not need to be told by Donald Trump that it needs to cut interest rates and resume large-scale asset purchases known as quantitative easing. Wall Street is looking to the Fed to pull out all the stops when it meets on Wednesday and the world’s most powerful central bank cannot afford to disappoint.
In the coming weeks the Bank of England can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1%
In the UK the coordinated response by the Bank of England and the Treasury last week was seen as a textbook example of how policymakers ought to respond to the crisis. It was, though, only the start. Airline companies will quickly go bust unless they receive financial assistance. The same goes for retailers, many of them hanging on by their fingertips even before Covid-19. Britain has a new chancellor of the exchequer in Rishi Sunak and, from Monday, a new governor of the Bank of England in Andrew Bailey, and they will both be aware that the risks of doing too little too late are far greater than those of doing too much too soon.
So, in the coming weeks the Bank can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1% – the lowest they have ever been – and to resume its QE programme. Sunak will have to add to the £12bn he has set aside to deal with Covid-19.
As in 2008-09, the authorities in the eurozone have been slowest to act but there have been welcome signs in recent days – from Germany, most significantly – of the need for governments to spend, and spend big.
It has been clear from the start that Covid-19 affects both sides of the economy: supply and demand. The supply of goods and services is impaired because factories and offices are shut and output falls as a result. But demand also falls because consumers stay at home and stop spending, and businesses mothball investment.
Conventional policy measures – such as cutting the cost of borrowing or reducing taxes – tend to work better when there is a demand shock. There is a limit to what they can do in the event of a combined supply and demand shock.
Policymakers know that, which is why Sunak stressed in his budget speech that the economy faced a tough period. The aim is make the downturn as short and shallow as possible, even though the chances of this look vanishingly small.
One reason for that is because the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 is enormous. Entire countries – Italy and Spain – are in lockdown. The problems facing airline companies are symptomatic of a crisis facing the global travel industry, from cruise companies to hotels that cater for tourists. Discretionary spending by consumers appears to have collapsed in recent days.
Despite globalisation, much economic activity remains local but here, too, there will be an impact as people cancel appointments at the dentist, put off having their hair cut and wait to put their house on the market.
Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has estimated that output in Britain will shrink by 2.5% in the second quarter but says a 5% fall is possible. The more pessimistic estimate looks quite plausible.
What’s more, in a service-sector dominated economy much of the lost output is never going to be recovered. If people do not go out to their weekly meal at their favourite local restaurant for the next two months they are not going to eat out four times a week when the fear of infection has been lifted.
It also seems likely that the economic pain will go on for longer than originally estimated. Having imposed bans and restrictions, governments and private-sector bodies will be cautious about removing them. Countries such as Italy will be wary of opening their borders while there is a fear of reinfection. The idea that Premier League football will be back by early April is fanciful.
There is also a question of how long it will take consumer and business confidence to recover. Policy action by central banks and finance ministries can help in this respect but only so much. The chances are that the imminent recession will be U-shaped: a steep decline followed by a period of bumping along the bottom. There will be recovery but it will take time and only after much damage has been caused."

Clean freak Naomi Campbell has the last laugh with coronavirus chic
","For the moment, at least, this is what a world without live entertainment looks like. Sport is basically cancelled, and not because it posted an offensive tweet 11 years ago when it had 39 followers and an egg for an avatar. Tours have been pulled, festivals postponed, and cinematic releases pushed back indefinitely, to a time one can only assume is “post-doomsday”, when everyone finally fancies having the bejesus scared out of them again by something that is not the live news feed on their recently disinfected phones.","

Sat 14 Mar 2020 17.30 GMT


For entertainment, I am left scrabbling for what I can get, and for a brief moment of respite from the onslaught of bad news, I have turned to the social media feeds of celebrities dealing with either having coronavirus, or trying not to get it, or trying to understand it.
So far, Naomi Campbell has emerged as the Dame Vera Lynn of this present situation, entertaining the virtual troops with her “I have not come to play” approach to hygiene. She has posted pictures of herself in the full hazmat, covered from head to toe, goggles, face mask and all, while travelling through Los Angeles airport. “Safety First NEXT LEVEL,” she wrote, adding a thank you to Linda Evangelista, which makes me wonder if there’s an underground network of supermodels doling out protective clothing to the rich and beautiful.
I have to admit, with only mild embarrassment, that this is not the first time I have thought of Campbell during this outbreak. Until very recently, I had an international flight planned, and I had already reminded myself of her infamous approach to inflight hygiene. In a video she posted to her YouTube channel last year, she got out a pair of gloves and a packet of Dettol wipes, and gave her first-class seat an astonishingly thorough wipe down. “I do not care what people think of me,” she said, as she cleaned. “It’s my health, and it makes me feel better.”
People mocked, at the time, but Campbell is having the last laugh, particularly if she is still sitting on a decent supply of antibacterial wipes. Tinie Tempah followed her lead, posting a picture of himself this week adopting the full hazmat on a train journey, though he also posted a clip of himself with his hood down, to which the one and only Naomi Campbell replied: “Keep your head covered.”
I’m starting to wonder if Campbell should be fronting a How Clean Is Your House?-style show, in which she swabs and cleanses her way through this weird new world, telling us all not to touch our faces. Release date: postponed until at least 2021.
After pouring out a spot of pancake batter for the departure of Sandi Toksvig, Great British Bake Off has announced that Little Britain’s Matt Lucas will be her replacement as co-host, joining Noel Fielding in the tent.
The current run of Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off specials will be Toksvig’s last, and Lucas will step in for the 11th series, due to air in the summer. “I’m chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television,” he said. “And bearing in mind my love of cake, I’ve already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation.”
Bake Off certainly needed something to help its dough rise again. Once, its only issue was that Paul’s handshake had become more of a talking point that the pastries. But the last series was a disappointment, to many fans and viewers. The contestants were all too young, and it was sorely lacking in a couple of seen-it-all-before grannies who could show the Instagram bakers how to do it.
The judges were too cutting, the tasks too tough and competitive, the challenges a world away from its “whip us up a nice Victoria sponge while we make a smutty joke about cream” origins. Bake Off was supposed to be nice, and watching people cry over split custard was never what it was there for.
Still, plenty of people who thought the show would not survive its transition from BBC to Channel 4, from Mary Berry to Prue Leith, from Mel and Sue to Toksvig and Fielding. But, as unlikely a pairing as it first sounded, they made it work. And it will work again, particularly if they step back from being quite so hard on the participants. After all, the show is bigger than its parts, bigger, even, than the new trousers Lucas is having made.
Any announcement that a much-loved videogame will be turned into a TV show or a film is usually about as promising as finding out that a successful British sitcom is being remade for a US audience. Yes, The Office, but for every show that worked, there are a thousand Skins and Inbetweeners, ideas that ended up so neutered you were desperate for any character to be allowed to say a single, even minor, rude word.
That could be about to change, though, with news that the best game of all time is being adapted for the small screen. The Last Of Us is about a journey across post-apocalyptic America, after the world has been ravaged by an infectious mutant fungus – timely! – and it is being made for HBO, which suggests it will have the money it needs to make its post-social-distancing landscapes look spectacular.
More impressively, it will be helmed by Craig Mazin, whose surname is also a review of the job he did when he wrote Chernobyl. Mazin will work with the game’s creative director, Neil Druckmann. “Getting a chance to adapt this breathtaking work of art has been a dream of mine for years, and I’m so honoured to do it in partnership with Neil,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. It could be a, er, game-changer.

America has no real public health system – coronavirus has a clear run

","Trump’s response has been inadequate but the system is rigged anyway. As always, the poor will be hit hardest
Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and just about the only official in the Trump administration trusted to tell the truth about the coronavirus, said last Thursday: “The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now … It is a failing, let’s admit it.”
While we’re at it, let’s admit something more basic. The system would be failing even under a halfway competent president. The dirty little secret, which will soon become apparent to all, is that there is no real public health system in the United States.
The ad hoc response fashioned late Friday by House Democrats and the White House may help a bit, although it’s skimpy, as I’ll explain.
As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it.
n America, the word 'public' means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good
Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job.
At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word “public” – as in public health, public education or public welfare – means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good.
Contrast this with America’s financial system. The Federal Reserve concerns itself with the health of financial markets as a whole. Late last week the Fed made $1.5tn available to banks, at the slightest hint of difficulties making trades. No one batted an eye.
When it comes to the health of the nation as a whole, money like this isn’t available. And there are no institutions analogous to the Fed with responsibility for overseeing and managing the public’s health – able to whip out a giant checkbook at a moment’s notice to prevent human, rather than financial, devastation.
Even if a test for the Covid-19 virus had been developed and approved in time, no institutions are in place to administer it to tens of millions of Americans free of charge. Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Healthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity. As a result, the nation’s supply of ventilators isn’t nearly large enough to care for projected numbers of critically ill coronavirus victims unable to breathe for themselves. Its 45,000 intensive care unit beds fall woefully short of the 2.9 million likely to be needed.
The Fed can close banks to quarantine financial crises but the US can’t close workplaces because the nation’s social insurance system depends on people going to work.
Almost 30% of American workers have no paid sick leave from their employers, including 70% of low-income workers earning less than $10.49 an hour. Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave. Friday’s deal between House Democrats and the White House won’t have much effect because it exempts large employers and offers waivers to smaller ones.
Most jobless Americans don’t qualify for unemployment insurance because they haven’t worked long enough in a steady job and the ad-hoc deal doesn’t alter this. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps and other public assistance is now linked to having or actively looking for work.
It’s hard to close public schools because most working parents cannot afford childcare. Many poor children rely on school lunches for their only square meal a day. In Los Angeles, about 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year.
There is no public health system in the US, in short, because the richest nation in the world has no capacity to protect the public as a whole, apart from national defense. Ad-hoc remedies such as House Democrats and the White House fashioned on Friday are better than nothing, but they don’t come close to filling this void.
Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

Working from home? Video conference call tips for the self-isolating

Sirin Kale","Video conference calls will be on the rise during the coronavirus crisis. Try these dos and dont’s if you can’t get into the office

The first rule when it comes to video conference calling is, don’t dress for the beach. Or the gym. Or bed. “One time I had a woman on the call in a spaghetti strap tank top,” says technology executive Amy Bailey. She manages a team of 10 remote workers from her home in California. Video conferencing technology is integral to her job: her team could not function without their daily morning video call. “I said: ‘I know you’re at home, but we can see a bit too much. Put a blouse on!’”
As the coronavirus epidemic continues, more of us will be working from home. Many won’t be digital natives, and may be coming to grips with video calling for the first time. How best to project an aura of professionalism from home?
All video calling software – Google Hangouts, BlueJeans, Zoom – have the same basic features: a mute button, a screen-sharing option to let other callers see what’s on your computer, and a chat function to type messages to other users.
“Mute your microphone if you aren’t talking,” advises Bailey. (Don’t forget to turn it back on if you want to say something.) If you’re unfamiliar with video calling, try practice calls to family and friends.
You know the guy. He drones on in meetings while everyone else shifts in their seats. Sometimes he steals his female co-workers’ ideas.
Video calling can make things worse. “It tends to enhance existing patterns of behaviour,” says Prof André Spicer, an expert in organisational behaviour at Cass Business School. “We know that males tend to dominate conversations, and with video calls this is often the case.”
The way to stop a mansplainer hijacking the call is for managers to be firm about who speaks, and for how long. “Follow good chairing protocols,” suggests Spicer. “At the beginning, say: ‘This is the purpose of the meeting, this is how long we’ve got, we’re going to spend this much time on each item.”
Just because you are working from home, doesn’t mean you can dress like a slob – from the waist up, that is. “I don’t expect my team to be perfect all the time,” says Bailey, “but make sure you’re dressed appropriately. Pyjamas aren’t an option!” Zoom gives you the option to digitally touch up your appearance, using technology not dissimilar to an Instagram filter. However, the touch-up option only blurs and brightens your complexion: good if you’ve got a hangover, but not exactly a digitally rendered suit.
Be mindful of what your colleagues can see behind you. An overflowing laundry basket doesn’t give the best impression. “A neutral backdrop is good, so people don’t get distracted,’’ says Spicer.
Technology can dehumanise interpersonal interactions. “I call them zoombies,” says Gianpiero Petriglieri, an associate professor of organisational behaviour at San Francisco business school INSEAD.
Petriglieri often teaches through video conferencing, and is aware of how the technology can cause people to disassociate from the content of the meeting. “You become a zoombie when your spirit is sapped from what you’re doing.”
To avoid technology-induced ennui, only hold video meetings when absolutely necessary. “Be deliberate about why you’re having the meeting,” says Petriglieri. The average European office worker spends 13 days a year in meetings, many of them pointless.
Be selective about who you invite. “Get as few people on the call as possible,” says Bruce Daisley, author of The Joy of Work. “When you’ve got a collection of 50 postage-stamp-sized faces on the screen, it’s impossible to feel connected. And when you don’t know everyone in the meeting, you speak less frankly.”
You wouldn’t openly browse Twitter during a meeting, so don’t do it in a video call. “Make eye contact with the camera,” says Bailey. “If you’re typing, mute your keyboard so other people don’t hear clicking.” Sit forward in your seat when others are talking, rather than slumping on your sofa – it shows your co-workers that you’re engaged.
If some people are dialling in from home, and others are at work, be mindful of the people physically absent. Meetings may be weighted in favour of the people in the room: they can exchange looks or read body language in a way those plugged in from home can’t.
Petriglieri often teaches mixed seminars, where some participants are dialling in, and others are working from home. He uses the example of meetings between heads of states: there are the world leaders who sit at the conference table, and the aides on the chairs behind them.
People’s stress levels are actually higher when they work remotely. They think their boss doesn’t trust them
“The best advice I can give is to be mindful of the people in the second row,” says Petriglieri. “You need to develop a muscle for inclusion.” When he is lecturing, he is careful to draw on students online, as well as those in the room, to avoid what he terms “extreme asymmetry”.
If you are in a meeting room with a large screen showing people dialled in from home, Petriglieri recommends asking participants at home to raise their hands if they want to talk. “It’s easy to ignore people who aren’t in the room if the conversation is getting going,” he says. “Ask people to let you know if someone is raising their hand and you don’t see it.”
So much of our interaction in meetings is nonverbal. The eye-roll behind your boss’s back; the strained smile when the office bore drones on. With video calling, these subtleties are lost – which is why many workers will often have a sneaky chat going on with their co-workers at the same time.
But a chat message is much more permanent than an eye-roll. “These messages can be recorded by your employers,” says Spicer, “and people can be held accountable for them. An informal eye roll can be disavowed, but an instant message on a company server can’t.” So, if you’re tempted to gripe about how tedious the video call is to a trusted colleague – use your personal mobile phone instead. 
If you’re sharing a slide-deck or other notes during a video call, other people in the meeting will be able to screenshot those materials without you realising. Which is fine if you trust your colleagues, but good to be aware of nonetheless.
“The interesting thing about remote working is that people always think it will be better,” says Daisley. “But people’s stress levels are actually higher when they work remotely. It’s stressful and lonely. We think our boss doesn’t trust us and our team doesn’t like us.”
One-to-one video calling can help combat social isolation. “I work for a company where 80% of the employees work remotely,” says Bailey. “Our HR department encourages us to call people via video call instead of sending them an email, so that you can have that face-to-face interaction. It adds time, but it helps you engage more with your co-workers.” US software startup GitHub even runs Remote Happy Hours for employees working from home – although of course, they have to drink whatever’s in their fridge.
Like any technology, video calling is neutral. It’s about how you use it. Don’t drone on, waste time, or speak for the sake of it, and you’ll get the most of video calling software. And remember: if you are watching Netflix instead of working, always put your microphone on mute."

The Zoo of the New, edited by Nick Laird and Don Paterson. Such an anxious moment surely calls for the consolations of poetry. What you need is this fat anthology, in which Rosemary Tonks nestles up to Tennyson, and Sappho sits in close proximity to Seamus Heaney. Or what about The Prelude, Wordsworth’s epic autobiographical poem? Even if you can’t leave the house, its hundreds of pages will transport you swiftly and elegantly to the Lakeland fells – and, perhaps, to the happier times of your own childhood.
Middlemarch by George Eliot. Maybe you want a novel. This is a book so capacious and wise it cannot fail to suit a period of quarantine.
Chips: The Diaries of Sir Henry Channon. Not only are these journals, written by the snobbish, American-born Conservative MP for Southend, witty, gossipy and completely engrossing; they also cover the blitz and, as a result, come with a built-in sense of perspective. These bad times, like other bad times before them, will surely pass in the end.
My Dad Wrote a Porno. If you’ve never got round to listening to this, now’s the time. With loads of episodes, every one hilarious, ridiculous and with no relevance to real life, this podcast will cheer anyone up.
The Allusionist. This is about language, and never fails to engage: clever, witty, distracting.
In the Dark: Season 2. One for true-crimers. It’s about a Mississippi man who faced trial for the same murders six times: a shocking miscarriage of justice case, doggedly and brilliantly told. (Season 1 is also excellent, but it’s about child abduction and I found it quite distressing.) 
Detectorists (iPlayer/Amazon). Nothing happens. But this gentle tale of treasure-seekers, penned by Mackenzie Crook, who co-stars with Toby Jones (left), contains sublime depths and sharp humour amid the whimsy. Let Johnny Flynn’s achingly soft music wash over you as you watch the meadows, old stone and butterflies of England, and wonder when it’ll be safe to leave the house again to seek them.
Money Heist (Netflix). It sounds much better in the original Spanish (La Casa de Papel, or House of Paper) but it’s still the best subtitled/dubbed thing around. Combines a series of ingenious thefts with, for once, truly three-dimensional characters. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll fall in love. And series 4 lands in April.
Mendelssohn: Octet (1825). As exuberant and joyful as music gets; eight string players jostle for attention, chipping in like a witty dinner-table argument. Mendelssohn was only 16 when he wrote it.
Bach: Goldberg Variations (1741). Sharpen your brain with one of the greatest works of all time, Bach’s “aria” and 30 variations supposedly written to amuse an insomniac count. Fit to refresh the most jaded spirits.
Wagner: The Ring (1876). Wagner demands time, in the case of his epic four-part Ring cycle (Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Siegfried, Götterdämmerung), about 15 hours. All human life is there, and gods, valkyries and dragons, too.
An Elephant Sitting Still (2018) on BFI Player. In a time of global emergency, frivolity can feel inappropriate. That mood has me inclined towards something more sombre and reflective, like the late Chinese filmmaker Hu Bo’s searching, rageful four-hour drama.
The Matrix (1999) on Amazon Prime. Escaping into a virtual reality is also an option. Twenty years on, the Wachowski sisters’ cyberpunk dystopia feels a little dated but their vision of the future is fun to revisit."

Coronavirus: Australia's performing arts industry 'could be brought to the brink'

The Australian arts industry operates on a knife-edge at the best of times – but in recent years, the pressure has reached boiling point: local creators have faced millions in funding cuts, with draconian laws decimating once thriving scenes.
Now, with the coronavirus pandemic causing the Australian government to recommend any gathering of more than 500 people be cancelled, the industry is bracing for the worst, with insiders describing “a growing sense of doom” about what’s to come – and politicians and industry bodies calling for an “urgent” plan to help.
Internationally, the threat of coronavirus has led to the cancellation of major tours and festivals including Coachella and Miami Ultra, and the stock of global tour promoter Live Nation plummeting $1.8m in a single day. But it was the nixing of SxSW that sent shockwaves through the Australian music industry.
Forty-three Australian artists had been selected from a pool of 7,000 to showcase at Austin, Texas: a rare opportunity to get in front of international managers, bookers and publishers, which can result in major global deals. Industry body Sounds Australia quickly pulled together a showcase livestream for 18 artists, but the cancellation was a substantial hit, and devastating for many.
And there have been big gig losses in Australia too: Miley Cyrus’s cancelled trip to Australia spelled the end for a major bushfire relief concert; Robbie Williams is no longer playing tonight in Melbourne; and My Chemical Romance’s decision not to tour saw major emo-punk festival Download cancel in Sydney and Melbourne, just seven days out from the event.
All this before the government’s announcement on public gatherings – and there is no way to predict how long it will last.
That was one bet that Mona founder and prolific gambler David Walsh didn’t want to take: he called off Hobart’s Dark Mofo festival on Wednesday, despite the fact that it was scheduled three months away, in June.
“A festival-wide last-minute cancellation would run into the millions, and likely end the event permanently,” said festival director Leigh Carmichael.
“I know [this] will murder an already massacred tourism, but I feel like I have no choice,” said Walsh.
Late on Friday, participants of Melbourne International Comedy Festival (MICF) were told the full festival was being cancelled. With more than 600 Australian and international acts, and more than 7,000 performances programmed, the three-week event was scheduled to begin on 25 March.
“We’re devastated by the news we have to share,” organisers told the participants, before announcing the cancellation. “Our primary concern is the health and welfare of our artists and participants, staff and audiences.”
The decision, while sad, was considered the right one by many artists involved: while some MICF events are run by the festival, who carry the risk, the majority are self-produced – and independent acts had been struggling to decide whether or not to go ahead.
“The way it’s structured makes it hard for small artists to make the call to cancel without anything official happening,” one told the Guardian, “but people [were] feeling awful about trying to promote in this environment – not just because of low turnout, but because it [felt] reckless.”
As of Friday, the festival had not confirmed whether it would be refunding registration costs, which run from $375-$685, or helping artists recoup other costs such as venue hire and staffing.
The news that MICF is cancelled is sad, also the right call, but mainly very confusing for my performance anxiety which, at the same time each year, prays MICF will be cancelled. (ps. Sorry! I didn’t mean it! I take it back! The Secret works oh no!)
Friday’s announcement recommending the cancellation of mass gatherings presents a major blow to Australia’s live performing arts industry, which contributes more than $2.5bn to the economy, according to industry bodies – but relies on getting people through the door.
Evelyn Richardson, the chief executive of industry body Live Performance Australia, issued a statement on Friday calling for the government to help.
“[With a forced] cancellation of live performance events, they need to … urgently develop a targeted relief package to keep businesses operating,” she said. “There are companies that will not have the balance sheet strength to withstand the combined impacts of box office failure and contract obligations, and some larger event cancellations may cause irreparable damage.”
The Australian Major Performing Arts Group echoed the sentiments in their own Friday statement, with shadow minister for the arts, Tony Burke, weighing in with his: “Australia’s arts sector was already fragile before the coronavirus crisis due to the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government’s cuts and neglect. Now with live performance ticket sales dropping and the list of cancelled events growing rapidly, the sector could be brought to the brink over coming months.”
When “no show means no income” in the performance industry, Burke said, “the government needs a plan for the arts sector and we need to hear what it is – urgently”.
At the time of publishing, neither Bluesfest (April), Vivid Sydney (May) or Splendour in the Grass (July) had announced cancellations – although if the government’s advice on mass gatherings remains in place, and is heeded, they will not be going ahead.
Doubt has been thrown on festivals with events that attract smaller crowds, too.
It’s the smaller companies and independent artists that are going to suffer the most
Announcing the program of Sydney writers’ festival on Thursday night, director Michaela McGuire added a caveat to the list of names: “There are inevitable lineup changes every year – but we are expecting more than most.”
By Friday, the festival had suspended ticket sales. “We are now carefully working through next steps and we’ll be in touch on Monday 16 March with a more detailed response,” CEO Chrissy Sharp said in a statement.
Theatre insiders are feeling anxious. Executive director of Theatre Network Australia, Nicole Beyer, told the Guardian, “If a project is cancelled, the independent artist’s wage is just completely gone. They’re on contract to contract. There’s no fallback. They can’t use leave.
“It’s the smaller companies and independent artists that are going to suffer the most,” she continued. “They don’t have reserves. They don’t have a way to get through bad times.”
Beyer supports the calls for federal stimulus. “We hope that the government will do the right thing by this industry.”
And the screen industry is facing its own risks. Production of Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic on the Gold Coast was halted this week after Tom Hanks was diagnosed with the virus; and according to reports, Marvel movie Shang-Chi – currently filming at Fox Studios in Sydney with a team of approximately 900 people – has suspended filming for two weeks, as director Destin Daniel Cretton awaits his test results.
Hollywood blockbusters operate in their own economy, but very few Australian arts bodies can take this kind of financial hit. In November it was said that many arts organisations – particularly smaller, independent groups – were already at “crisis point”. Then they spent the summer raising funds for the bushfire emergency. Now, it’s the pandemic. Do they have anything left to give?"

The Vivid Sydney light festival has been cancelled due to measures put in place to limit public gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus, as the number of diagnoses in Australia continues to rise.
However, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition – without crowds – into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. 
The number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New South Wales rose by 22 in 24 hours to 134, with more than 250 cases nationally. In Victoria, the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said eight new cases had been confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 57.
In Tasmania, passengers and crew were barred from disembarking from a cruise ship that docked in Hobart.
The NSW tourism minister, Stuart Ayres, said the decision to cancel Vivid was made after recommendations from the federal government to limit non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people.
Vivid, now in its 11th year, was scheduled to run from 22 May to 13 June.
“Vivid Sydney is a bright star of Sydney’s event calendar so the decision to cancel was not taken lightly. As the event owner, we must follow the advice of health officials to ensure the health and safety of our citizens and everyone involved with Vivid Sydney,” Ayres said.
“We have taken the decision early in consideration of those planning to travel to Sydney for the festival, our commercial partners, artists, and volunteers so as to minimise the disruption and impact on them.
“We are currently working through the full implications of the cancellation and will provide further information and advice as soon as it’s available.”
In 2019, a record 2.4 million attended Vivid, bringing $172m into the NSW economy.
Ayres said the decision to cancel was “another body blow” for the tourism industry, which has already endured challenges as a result of the bushfire crisis.
In NSW an additional 22 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 between 11am on Saturday and 11am on Sunday, NSW Health said in a statement.
The new cases include three people who recently returned from the United States, one who had returned from Singapore and another from the Philippines. Five people caught the infection after contact with other confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The source for the remainder of the 22 new cases is under investigation, however two of those had also travelled overseas recently, including one to the United States.
NSW Health said of the 134 cases, 60 were acquired overseas while 38 were infected after contact with a confirmed case. The remaining were either unknown or under investigation.
A further 1,924 cases in NSW were being investigated as possible Covid-19 cases while 20,511 people have been tested and cleared.
Meanwhile, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand’s NRL’s team the Warriors will stay in Australia after travel restrictions were announced by the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.
The second round will go ahead as scheduled without crowds.
“In the interim we will continue round two. At this stage we will play round two and assess the situation,” the Australian Rugby League commission chairman, Peter V’landys, said.
In Hobart, passengers and crews were told not to leave a cruise ship that docked in the city on Saturday. About 1,400 passengers and staff aboard the MSC Magnifica were told they could not return to the ship if they disembarked, an MSC Cruises spokeswoman told the Mercury.
No one on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers’ health. The ship left Italy in early January before the coronavirus became a global concern.
Tasmania’s acting director of public health, Scott McKeown, said on Saturday the state now had its sixth confirmed case of Covid-19 after a woman in her 60s tested positive.
She was identified as a close contact of a previous Tasmanian case, who had recently travelled overseas, McKeown said on Sunday.
The woman and all the other five cases in Tasmania were in a stable condition and remained in isolation receiving medical care.
The state’s Public Health Services had identified and contacted the woman’s close contacts. These people will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days and receive daily follow-up from PHS staff.
The new cases in Victoria this weekend include six men and two women with ages ranging from their teens to 60s.
One is a student – a known contact of case 17, a teacher from CareyGrammar. The student was not at school during their infectious period. Theschool will remain closed until the holidays. And as a precaution, 12classmates will home-isolate.
Sutton said all cases were recovering at home in isolation. All had acquired the infection from either overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19.
At present, there remained only one case in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission."

Melissa Davey","Exclusive: In letter to GPs Brendan Murphy says Covid-19 kits no longer available in some regions and there is ‘extreme pressure’ on protective equipment


Sat 14 Mar 2020 05.00 GMT


Last modified on Sat 14 Mar 2020 06.48 GMT


Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, has implored doctors for their help in a letter describing “extreme pressure” on personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing kits.
The letter, sent to all general practitioners on Friday said: “There is a particular issue I want to write to you about directly, to ask for your help.”
“Unfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,” Murphy wrote.
“Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing.”
As Australians rush to get tested, many people are being tested unnecessarily putting pressure on already stretched medical supplies. In the letter Murphy urges doctors to adhere to testing guidelines, and to make sure patients meet both the current epidemiological and clinical criteria for testing.
Only people who travelled internationally in the 14 days before illness onset or who had close or casual contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19, and also have a fever or acute respiratory infection need to be tested.
People with severe pneumonia with or without recent international travel are also classified as a suspect case requiring testing.
The head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone urged Australians to take some personal responsibility and to stop pushing doctors for Covid-19 testing unless they met the criteria or were severely unwell.
We are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can’t just be testing to relieve anxiety.
“It’s clear that there is a significant amount of people who are being tested at the moment for no other reason than just fear, anxiety or personal interest,” Bartone told Guardian Australia.
“The criteria that have been clearly outlined in the letter are in the interest of ensuring adequate supply at this crucial time while we’re facing a significant pressure on reagents and kits.
“We are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can’t just be testing to relieve anxiety. We can’t just be relieving anxiety in a population with no contact with a confirmed case.”
Bartone said the rush to hospitals and doctor clinics for testing was an extension of panic buying being seen in supermarkets. He urged people to think of vulnerable people including the elderly before asking for tests.
“This is a self-limiting condition. For a small minority it will have significant consequences and unfortunately many Australians will lose their lives. We need to make sure resources are allocated appropriately to minimise risk to communities as a whole. The more irresponsible we are the more likely we are to see an earlier onset and peak.”
On Saturday Murphy said during a press conference there had “been quite a run on the testing and we had some temporary shortages in testing materials”.
“I do want to emphasise that we are still saying, because community transmission is so low at the moment, that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are symptomatic,” he said. “We don’t want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to go and get tested. We need to preserve the testing for those who need it.”
The federal health department has published an updated fact sheet for the public about the virus.
President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, said countries where the tests originated from, including Italy, “are keeping their tests”.
“All the countries are in short supply for their own populations,” he said. “So yes, we are going to run into problems if we have low-threshold testing.”"

Paul Karp","Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says school closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food are ‘premature’ at the moment


Sun 15 Mar 2020 02.51 GMT


First published on Sun 15 Mar 2020 01.13 GMT


School closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food to prepare for coronavirus self-isolation are “premature” for the general population, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, have said, though all options are on the table.
Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin “practising” to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly.
Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required.
Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight’s worth of food.
Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled.
Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports “or things of that nature”.
On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government’s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a “six-month window” although it “might be longer”.
Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” he said. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
“There are no options that are off the table,” Hunt said. “The paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.”
Murphy said authorities were “strongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call ‘social distancing’.
“So that’s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact … not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.”
Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more “may well change” but Australia, which he said had “only 250 cases”, was still “ahead of the curve”.
“If you’re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should … [exercise] more social distancing,” he said, and “avoid things that aren’t essential”.
Murphy said for others the risk of attending public places with fewer than 500 people, such as a cinema, was still at this stage “relatively low” and at the moment authorities were not recommending people stop taking the train. As case numbers increase, the medical advice will respond to recommend greater social distancing, he said.
“I think the gym is fine but everybody at the moment needs to practise very good hygiene.
“If you’re going to the gym, I would be very focused on hand washing, using hand sanitisers, all of those social distancing, good hygiene measures, we want everybody in the community to start practising those.”
Asked about the Victorian chief medical officer’s suggestion people should stockpile a fortnight’s worth of food, Murphy replied it was “a little bit premature at the moment”.
“For most people we don’t want to encourage major panic buying at the moment – we’ve seen that with the supermarket chains. But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.”
Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice.
He said governments did not want to “move too early” because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and “taking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains”.
Murphy said there was “no question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they’ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time”. “So you don’t want to move too early.”
Murphy said there were “very few reports of symptomatic infection in children” and authorities don’t know “whether children are getting infected but just don’t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they’re not getting infected”. “The former is probably more likely.”
Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity.
Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they’re feeling unwell.
Murphy said Australian authorities define “close contact” – which requires self-isolation – as “someone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before”.
He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are “very, very unlikely to have been infectious”.
On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was “aghast” at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response.
Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy’s advice on hand shaking was “inconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying” and argued there is “no coherent advice” about whether schools should open from Monday.
Bowtell said the government appeared to “have no plan” for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was “imperative” to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals.
Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday.
Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an “abundance of caution” and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined.
Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined “the relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March”, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday’s meeting.
On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a “national cabinet” made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday.
So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn.
The Morrison government has set up a new coronavirus business unit in the Treasury to support business confidence, employment and business continuity."

Major Australian theme parks including Movie World, Sea World and Wet’n’Wild say they intend to remain open, despite the government saying gatherings of more than 500 people should not occur in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Following a meeting with state premiers on Friday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced mass gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The announcement has thrown sporting codes into chaos, spun the arts industry into disarray and led to the cancellation of major events such as the Royal Easter Show and the Melbourne Grand Prix.
But despite that, Australia’s famous cluster of theme parks on the Gold Coast say they intend to keep operating.
In a statement on Saturday, Village Roadshow, the owner of major parks Movie World, Sea World and Wet’n’Wild, said that after discussions with the Queensland government it believed “the nature of our business does not apply to this advisory”.
The company said it would put in place “additional stringent hygiene and safety measures” including “an increased number of hygiene hand-washing stations,” “updated signage” about hand-washing techniques and on-site nurses to address the spread of the virus, but would not close.
“At Village Roadshow Theme Parks, the safety and wellbeing of our guests and team members is our utmost priority,” the company said in a statement.
“The Council of Australian Government’s advice today regarding public gatherings was directed at static-seated events of more than 500 people for a duration of over two hours.
“Based on our discussions with the state government, the nature of our business does not apply to this advisory.”
That’s despite other major theme parks including Disneyland and Universal Studios in the US announcing their closure.
Disney announced on Friday that it would shut down its California theme parks until the end of March over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, while Florida’s Disney World would close to guests from Sunday.
Comcast’s Universal Studios theme park in southern California also said it would close from Saturday and expected to reopen 28 March.
The Queensland Electoral Commission will also insist that voters go to the polls for local government elections in the state on 28 March.
“The forthcoming Queensland elections are essential public events required to ensure the continuity of democratic representation and public administration across the state,” the Queensland electoral commissioner, Pat Vidgen, said.
“It is extremely unlikely that more than 500 people would ever be in a polling booth at any one time, and electors generally only spend a short period of time in a booth.
“The ECQ will continue to monitor advice being issued by health authorities to ensure that the elections are conducted with minimal risk to the health and safety of Queenslanders.”
Home affairs minister Peter Dutton, a Queensland resident, has taken the state’s coronavirus figure to 35. Queensland also began recording its first cases outside the south-east on Friday, including cases in the towns of Rockhampton and Kingaroy."

Supermarket giants have put limits on purchases of food staples to prevent panic buying sparked by the coronavirus.
Coles and Woolworths have introduced a limit on some goods to ensure there is enough for everyone, especially the elderly, by preventing people stockpiling.
Coles customers will be limited to two packets of pasta, flour, rice, paper towels, paper tissues and hand sanitiser per transaction, it confirmed on Friday.
Coles Group chief executive officer Steve Cain said there are “some additional limits on certain items in each store” and has temporarily suspended change-of-mind refunds.
“From today we will be temporarily suspending our change-of-mind refund policy to discourage over-purchasing,” he said in the statement.
“If you have already purchased additional items you no longer want, please look at donating them to community organisations or neighbours who have been struggling to purchase them during this time.”
Earlier in the week, Coles reduced their toilet roll limit from four packs to one per transaction, after shoppers stripped shelves amid fears of the spread of Covid-19.
Woolworths has dropped its toilet paper limit to one pack per customer transaction and restricted purchases of other basics.
Shoppers at Woolworths can buy two packs of tissues and hand sanitiser, and one pack of rice, paper towels, serviettes and wipes per shop.
The company will also no longer accept change-of-mind refunds and exchanges on some products in higher demand than usual, including toilet paper, tissues, rice and pasta.
Both companies are working to bring in more stock to keep up with panic-buying demand."

Ben Butler","Two big Australian banks abandoned plans to raise money from investors this week and observers say that’s just the start


Sat 14 Mar 2020 00.06 GMT


Last modified on Sat 14 Mar 2020 00.12 GMT


The devastation wrought on the Australian stockmarket by the coronavirus pandemic has made it impossible for companies to raise fresh money, with two bank funding injections totalling at least $2.5bn called off.
Billions of dollars in other attempts to raise money have also been cancelled as investors close their wallets after two wild weeks of trading erased more than a year’s worth of gains.
“Effectively, the window to raise capital is closed,” said fund manager Geoff Wilson of Wilson Asset Management, who himself this week canned a plan for one of his funds to buy between $10m and $20m worth of shares back from investors.
Asked if he thought it would open again any time soon, he said: “No.
“It would only be the desperate who would be raising [money] at the moment,” another market observer said.
On Thursday evening, after the biggest one-day fall on the Australian market since 1987, NAB abandoned plans to raise about $2bn by selling investors notes – financial instruments that pay a steady flow of coupons.
It’s believed the decision was taken following what sources said were “robust” discussions by the NAB board.
Smaller rival Macquarie followed suit on Friday morning, as the market was again plunging, yanking a $500m note issue of its own.
The notes, known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt, carry greater risk than either because they are the first to take losses when things go wrong.
But they are extremely popular with Australian mum-and-dad investors who have confidence in the strength of the country’s banking sector because they provide relatively high returns.
The prices of both were set last month, before the virus smashed the market. But after the falls in the share prices of the banks – on Friday night, NAB’s share price was down by a third since 20 February and Macquarie’s down almost a quarter over the same period – those prices became wildly unrealistic.
Sources said that if the NAB and Macquarie notes had been issued at pre-crash values then their prices would have immediately crashed once they began to trade, making investors angry and leaving the banks looking like they were under financial pressure.
“If they’d proceeded with it they would have been slaughtered when they came on,” one market source said of the NAB notes. “Obviously it’s bad for the investors but it’s also really bad for NAB.
“Which bank wants to issue capital at a massive discount?”
Sources say figuring out new prices for the notes was too hard because the markets were too volatile – a point proven on Friday when, after dropping 8% in early trade, the benchmark ASX 200 rallied to finish the day up more than 4%.
Also on Friday, Pengana Private Equity Fund abandoned a $470m capital raising, telling the market that “current market volatility makes it impossible to conduct an orderly process”.
The previous day, corporate lender Metrics Credit Partners handed more than $340m back to investors after falling well short on its hopes to raise up to $640m and list a fund on the ASX.
Wilson said the market as a whole was in a “fear phase”.
“This is the steepest fall we’ve ever seen in the market,” he said.
He said it combined the speed of the falls experienced in the crash of 1987 with the relentlessness of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when markets around the world fell day after day after day.
“This is the steepest fall we’ve ever seen in the market,” he said.
“From the start of the bear market [in 1987] to the bottom, that was about 50% and it took seven weeks.
“This has been faster.
“We’re a month in and we’re down something like 30%.”"

Ivanka Trump worked from home on Friday but will not self-quarantine, despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who on Friday confirmed he had tested positive for coronavirus.
Dutton released a statement late on Friday confirming that he had gone into self-isolation after testing positive for the virus.
The home affairs minister had recently returned from a trip to the US where he held meetings with senior Trump administration officials including Ivanka Trump, the US attorney-general, William Barr, and officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.
In a statement, the White House said it was aware Dutton had contracted the virus, but that senior officials would not need to quarantine because the minister was “asymptomatic during the interaction”.

Instead the president’s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka, who was photographed next to Dutton during the trip, worked from home on Friday “out of an abundance of caution and until guidance was given”.
“The White House is aware that Mr Dutton tested positive for Covid-19,” the White House said.
“He was asymptomatic during the interaction. Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine.
“She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.”
A spokesman for the attorney general William Barr also said the Attorney General would work from home on Friday but was not showing coronavirus symptoms.
“He is staying home today and has consulted with CDC,” Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.
“CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point.”
Other officials including a senior counsellor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, said she had been advised she did not need to quarantine.
“White House Medical Unit (WHMU) informed me earlier that Mr Dutton was asymptomatic during the interaction,” Conway wrote on Twitter.

“Exposures from the case were assessed and the WHMU confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that I exhibited no symptoms & need not self-quarantine.”
But New Zealand cabinet minister Tracey Martin, who met with Dutton during a Five-Eyes partners meeting in Washington DC, has reportedly gone into self-isolation following his diagnosis.
A spokesperson for Martin told Radio New Zealand that while the minister and New Zealand First had shown no symptoms, she had been tested for the virus and was self-isolating until test results were returned.
Martin reportedly did not shake Dutton’s hand when she was overseas.
On Tuesday Dutton attended a meeting with Australian cabinet members including the prime minister, Scott Morrison. He was also was part of a discussion of the national security committee of cabinet on Thursday via a video link.
However Morrison said late on Friday that he did not intend to be tested and that no one in the cabinet would be required to self-isolate. The prime minister did cancel plans to attend a football match in Sydney on Saturday.
Speaking to radio station 2GB on Saturday, Dutton, said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning.
But he said that he’d spoken to Queensland Health authorities on Friday night who had begun contact tracing back to Wednesday morning and were not concerned about his earlier contacts.
His wife and children had not displayed symptoms but were self-isolating.
“Their advice to me is they’re concerned with people that I’ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th. So beyond that, it’s not further back, there’s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there’s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That’s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.”
Dutton is not the first person to be diagnosed with the coronavirus to have recently come into contact with senior members of the US government.
On Friday the White House said the president, Donald Trump, had no plans to be tested for coronavirus or go into self-quarantine after attending events last weekend with a senior Brazilian official who tested positive for the illness.
Fabio Wajngarten, a communications secretary to Jair Bolsonaro, met with Trump during a visit by the Brazilian president to Florida.
On Thursday the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said both Trump and the vice-president Mike Pence, who was also at the meeting, had “almost no interactions” with Wajngarten and therefore did not need to be tested themselves.
But during the visit Wajngarten shared on Instagram a picture of himself, Trump, Pence and Brazilian TV presenter Alvaro Garnero, while in one video, Wajngarten (wearing glasses) was seen just behind Bolsonaro and Trump."

Michael McGowan","Chief medical officer warns people being tested unnecessarily and that virus may not peak until ‘well into the middle of the year’

The Australian government has announced a national publicity blitz aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 as the country’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the infection rate of the virus may not peak until “well into the middle of the year”.
As Australians brace for the shutdown of major sporting codes, concerts and festivals in a dramatic scaling-back of day-to-day life not seen since the Second World War, the federal government has announced the release of a national advertising campaign to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. Australia now has 200 cases of the virus, as New South Wales reported 20 new cases on Saturday, its biggest daily increase since the pandemic began.
The education campaign comes after criticism of the government’s response to the crisis and an acknowledgement by the chief medical officer that the country’s supply of crucial medical equipment including personal protective gear and pathology test kits was “deteriorating rapidly”.
From Sunday, the government will release two separate television advertisements which encourage stringent personal hygiene and warn people who have recently been overseas or in contact with someone who has the virus to “seek medical advice” and self-isolate if they develop symptoms.
The campaign, which will also include outdoor advertising on buses, at train stations and in shopping centres, includes the slogan “together we can help stop the spread and stay healthy”.
It also advises people to only be tested for the virus “if you are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms and have recently returned overseas or have been indirect contact with someone who is known to have contracted coronavirus”.
Earlier on Saturday the country’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the spread of the virus may not peak until “well into the middle of the year”.
“If we get a large outbreak [it] could go well into the middle of the year before it peaks,” he said.
“But there are some countries ... which seems to have peaked quite early and controlled the outbreak. One of the things we know about outbreaks and epidemics as they are very hard to predict.
“But it depends how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day.”
If the virus were to continue to spread more rapidly into the winter, it could place significant strain on Australia’s medical resources. As the Guardian has reported, a letter sent by Murphy to GPs on Friday warned the country’s supply of personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing kits was already under “extreme pressure” with supplies “deteriorating rapidly”.
“Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing,” Murphy wrote.
Also on Saturday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, spoke publicly for the first time since he was diagnosed with the virus. Speaking to a Sydney radio station from his sickbed at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Dutton said he was feeling “much better” and insisted health officials were not concerned about his contact with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, or Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president.
“Fever has gone this morning, temperature is down, my throat was very mild to start with so probably still a bit sore but very mild in that sense,” he said.
Dutton, who said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning, attended a cabinet meeting with senior government ministers including the prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and before that was in the US where he met with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president.
Both Trump and Barr worked from home on Friday in the US after Dutton’s diagnosis was confirmed, but the home affairs minister said that he’d spoken to Queensland health authorities who were not concerned about his earlier contacts.
“Their advice to me is they’re concerned with people that I’ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th,” Dutton said.
“So beyond that, it’s not further back, there’s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there’s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That’s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.”
In New Zealand, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that anyone entering the country, except for people from Pacific Islander countries, would need to self-isolate for two weeks.
That announcement, which comes despite the country recording only six cases of the virus so far, has potentially widespread consequences for the Super Rugby and NRL competitions already beleaguered by the Australian government’s decision to advise against all mass gatherings of more than 500 people.
“This decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,” Ardern said on Saturday.
In further developments courts across the state of Victoria in Australia will immediately suspend all future jury trials in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. The drastic measure will apply to the county and supreme courts.
Supreme court chief justice Anne Ferguson said all new jury trials would be suspended but that trials in which a jury had already been empanelled would continue.
“This means that the jury empanelment process, in which hundreds of potential jurors gather at court, will not take place until further notice,” Ferguson said.
The Northern Territory local court announced on Saturday evening it too would suspend all circuit court services effective immediately.

Trump tests negative for coronavirus and expands travel ban to UK and Ireland

Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus as he announced new measures to tackle the crisis, including expanding the existing US travel ban to cover the UK and Ireland.
In a lunchtime briefing at the White House on Saturday, the president confirmed he had taken a test for the virus after coming into contact with a Brazilian government official last week in Florida who later tested positive for the disease.
The president’s physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement on Saturday evening that Trump’s test was negative. 
“One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago [in Florida], the president remains symptom-free,” Conley said in his memo. “I have been in daily contact with the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.”
Dr Conley had said on Friday that there was no need to quarantine the president or implement a test because the encounter with Bolsonaro aide Fabio Wajngarten was “low risk”.
But on Saturday it was reported that Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who was also at Mar-a-Lago, had been tested after displaying relevant symptoms.
On Saturday, Trump told the media he had taken a test on Friday night after all, announcing it at a press conference to which reporters were admitted only after having their temperatures taken, and from which one unidentified journalist was turned away.
Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump entered self-isolation on Friday after meeting an Australian politician later revealed to have tested positive. News of Trump’s test followed days of controversy highlighted by his continuing to shake hands with people, even as official advice recommended “social distancing”.
“It becomes a habit. People walk up to me, they shake hands, it’s kind of a natural reflex,” Trump said. “Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I tend to agree.”
He also indicated the extension of the travel ban, already in place for 26 European nations. The vice-president, Mike Pence, duly announced that travelers from the UK and Ireland would be subject to the ban from midnight US eastern time on Monday.
The president also raised the prospect of some kind of domestic travel restrictions, and advised the public: “If you don’t have to travel I wouldn’t do it.”
Trump welcomed legislation passed by the US House that will help fund paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing and other measures to help Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
“It will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus,” he said.
Nonetheless, the administration’s response remains subject to criticism, particularly after the press conference on Friday. There, Trump announced a national emergency, paving the way for billions of dollars to be made accessible to authorities attempting to slow the pandemic.
“It opened up avenues we would never be able to open up without it,” he said at the Saturday briefing. “It will make more than $50bn available to us in disaster relief funds. And that’s available for states, territories and local governments. A lot of people are benefiting from it.”
But on Friday Trump also announced a new self-diagnosis website created by Google, only for the tech giant to deny the project was on anything like the scale outlined; said “I don’t take responsibility at all” when asked why the US lagged behind other countries in testing; and reacted angrily to a question about why a White House office for pandemic response was closed in 2018.
According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), there are 1,629 cases of coronavirus in the US with 41 deaths, and 46 states and the District of Columbia have reported infections. Other estimates, including Trump’s, are higher.
Concerns have been expressed that the US does not have enough hospital beds or ventilators. As many as 20% of coronavirus infections could require patients to receive mechanical ventilation. If estimates of more than 1m infections prove accurate, there could be more than 200,000 such cases.
According to a Johns Hopkins study based on data from 2010, US acute care hospitals own about 62,000 full-featured ventilators. The study, published in February, reported an additional 98,000 that can provide basic function.
The CDC Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) has an estimated 8,900 ventilators. At the White House on Friday, Trump said: “We have ordered a large number of respirators just in case.”
Across the US, authorities have declared emergencies, closed schools and restricted public gatherings. In New York City the largest public school system in the US remains open, a key support for millions. Pressure on the mayor, Bill de Blasio, is increasing.
New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced on Saturday that the state had recorded its first coronavirus fatality, an 82-year-old woman with pre-existing medical issues. Cuomo said the state had 524 confirmed cases, 117 hospitalised, but said officials believe thousands have the virus.
On Capitol Hill, the relief bill passed just before 1am, after two days of talks between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Agreement came after Trump signaled his support.
Pelosi thanked Democrats for their patience. Trump and the speaker never communicated directly and Trump did not thank Pelosi directly on Saturday.
The legislation now goes to the Senate. It ensures free testing for those who need it while increasing access to benefits including family medical leave, paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, spending on health insurance for the poor and food programmes for children and the elderly.
On Friday, a federal judge blocked an administration attempt to force nearly 700,000 people off food stamps, a key benefit for poor Americans. District court judge Beryl Howell cited the coronavirus outbreak and said the attempted action was capricious, arbitrary and probably unlawful.
The economic impact of the impact continued, meanwhile, as ​​Apple announced that all stores outside China would close ​for two weeks."

Only 36% of Britons trust Boris Johnson on coronavirus, poll finds

Toby Helm Observer political editor","Opinium survey shows fear of nation – but finds just 53% are washing their hands moreCoronavirus – latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage

The public trusts coronavirus information and advice given by Britain’s leading medical experts far more than statements by politicians, according to an opinion poll on how people are reacting to the pandemic.
While the government is seen, overall, as having handled the crisis well – with 44% approving and 30% disapproving of its reaction – the survey by Opinium for the Observer shows people have more faith in those with medical and scientific knowledge than they have in the nation’s political leaders.
Fewer than two in five (36%) said they trusted what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on the subject, while just 37% trusted the information given by the health secretary, Matt Hancock.
However, 59% said they placed their faith in the chief medical adviser to the UK government, Chris Whitty, and 55% said they would trust the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The findings suggest that the government has been wise to put Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, at the forefront of its public information campaign as it tries to promote awareness and minimise the effects of Covid-19.
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.
Justin McCurry
Seven in 10 people say they have changed aspects of their behaviour in some way since the virus began to spread. About 28% say they have stopped shaking hands, 20% have stopped touching their own faces and 18% have postponed making plans for holidays, while 8% have cancelled holidays already booked.
Despite the fact that the prime minister and medical experts have said washing hands regularly is the most important step people can take, only 53% of those asked said they were doing so more than they usually do. Almost three-quarters of people (73%) said they were now worried about the virus. About 47% of UK adults thought the virus would have a negative effect on their own finances, up from 34% at the start of the week. About 80% thought it would have a negative effect on the national economy.
There is now a widespread belief among the public that the virus will strike them or those close to them. Two in five (42%) think it is likely that they will catch the virus themselves, while 46% think a close family member will catch it. Half (51%) think a colleague will catch it.
The public is very divided when asked if the government has done enough to combat the virus. In London, where the proportion already struck by the virus is highest, people are most likely to say the authorities have not done enough. Across the country as a whole, about 41% think the government’s response has been proportionate, against 40% who say it has “underreacted”. But in London, only 32% think its reaction has been proportionate, with 55% saying it has not done enough.
The public also appears to be reconciled to the idea that more drastic measures will need to be taken soon. About 76% think flights from virus hotspots will need to be banned, and 68% think handwash and toilet paper will need to be rationed. About 44% think schools will need to be closed, against 26% who think this would be unnecessary.
Adam Drummond of Opinium said that while more people approved of the government’s response than had a negative view of it, public opinion could switch if the situation worsened dramatically.
“The fact that only 42% believe that they will contract coronavirus while the government’s strategy assumes that a significantly higher proportion will become infected means there is the risk of a nasty shock for a substantial slice of the electorate,” he said.
Opinium interviewed 2,005 UK adults between Thursday and Friday. "

Brexit: coronavirus sparks calls to extend EU transition period

Britain and the EU are facing calls to back away from a “game of chicken” and extend the Brexit transition period immediately, as both respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
Boris Johnson, however, has insisted there will be no change to the transition period – during which the UK follows EU regulations, including its free movement laws. It is scheduled to finish at the end of the year.
However, with parts of Europe in lockdown and the UK government expecting the peak of the crisis in Britain in late spring and early summer, some experts are calling for immediate agreement to delay.
There are concerns that the peak of the disease in the UK could coincide with critical negotiation deadlines. June is the final month for Britain to ask for an extension beyond this year.
Trade expert David Henig is among those calling for a rethink. “I don’t see how you can realistically, by the end of June, make a decision on how trade talks are going,” he said. “You would be doing it with a lot of people under pressure, dealing with something that really is an arbitrary deadline. This is the classic force majeure cause – an unforeseen circumstance of the extreme degree.
“This should apply to both sides. The Italians are practically completely in lockdown. They have stopped having all but essential meetings in Brussels. It’s a bit of a game of chicken, with neither side wanting to say they can’t cope with it. An extension could be offered on whatever strict terms.”
He also warned the EU that there were signs that its response to the latest round of talks was not as effective as its approach to Britain’s EU divorce deal, finally voted through parliament earlier this year. “The commission are going through the ‘difficult second album’ phase this time round,” he said. “Last time, they were undoubtedly the grown-ups in the room. It’s less clear that that applies this time.”
Matthew O’Toole, a former adviser to Theresa May who is now an SDLP politician in Northern Ireland’s assembly, agreed. “Right now, I’m loth to even mention Brexit,” he tweeted. “But, as of today, the UK government is still ruling out extending transition. That is lunatic. The world will soon be recovering from a huge economic shock. No one – not the EU or even Trump’s US – will have time for Brexiter fantasies.”
Face-to-face talks, due this week in London, have already been cancelled amid the crisis. Other methods of remote communication are being used. Initial plans suggested there would be five rounds of talks by mid-May, before a crucial summit in June."

More than 126,000 people globally have now been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, out of whom 67,000 have recovered, and more than 4,600 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
During the first wave of infections in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analysed data from 44,672 people who had the virus. This research showed that 80.9% of patients experienced mild symptoms, 13.8% required hospitalisation and experienced severe symptoms, and 4.7% were critical cases requiring intensive care.
Although Covid-19 has spread to 116 countries, the vast majority of cases have been confirmed in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, where the pandemic originated. Taken with the 110,000 cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, this amounts to 87% of cases in total.
The rate of infection in Italy has been observed to be similar to that of Hubei. The extraordinary efforts of the Chinese state to contain the virus seem to have slowed the spread of the disease in a population used to authoritarian government. Italy’s government has ordered all shops, bars and restaurants across the country to close and has restricted travel in order to slow the outbreak.
Local factors relating to healthcare systems, availability of testing for the virus, population demographics and government interventions will all have a bearing on the course of the disease in every country in which it appears. The largest European outbreak is in Italy, where 23% of the population is aged over 65 and where 6% of cases have resulted in a fatality. Major outbreaks are also occurring in South Korea and Iran where there are fewer older people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%. In 2002, Sars spread to 37 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. The Spanish flu was the deadliest pandemic in history, killing up to 100 million people between 1918 and 1920."

Orderly, dour, cowed: how my beloved Italy is changed by coronavirus
",by  Tobias Jones,"Holed up with his family in their Parma flat, our writer tells of the eerie atmosphere in a country usually known for sociability, chaos and fun


Sun 15 Mar 2020 10.15 GMT


Since the whole of Italy was put in quarantine last Monday, it has been surreal here in the northern city of Parma. When you wander around the alleys and squares, you begin to feel like the protagonist of a post-apocalyptic film, constantly asking yourself, “Where is everyone?”
If you do see a solitary human, their reaction is diffidence, if not alarm: they adjust their face mask and move away. The habitual warmth of Italians has been replaced by self-preserving coolness. A very touchy-feely country is now obsessed by personal space.
That eerie sense of living in the end times only increases when you watch the news. Prison riots erupted across the country last week. There was a mass break-out in Foggia (six inmates are still at large). At Milan’s San Vittore prison, black smoke was seen gushing from the windows, and seven inmates died in violence in Modena. The police patrols and blockades only make things feel more ominous.
Free movement within a borderless Europe already seems like a distant memory: there were 90km queues on the Brenner pass (into Austria) last week, and Slovenia has blocked its roads with Italy. It is understandable that Italy, the country with the highest rate of coronavirus infections outside China, should be isolated, but to Italians it feels as if the country is being left to rot. Italy has received more aid from China than from the US or the EU.
Every day the numbers of Italy’s infections and deaths leap by 20% or 30%. Parma is in the Emilia-Romagna region, where so far more than 2,000 people have tested positive and more than 200 have died. In the province of Parma there have been more than 518 cases. One of those, Giovanna, is a close family friend. It feels as if the darkness just keeps getting closer.
The intensive care units are now all full. Hospital wards are spilling out into corridors, tents, car parks, gardens and commercial warehouses. We are hearing words – like “triage” – which are usually associated with warfare. Medics and nurses are having to make decisions on which patients to prioritise. Some doctors have died, and others have compared the numbers of admissions to dealing with “an earthquake every day”.
Part of the weirdness comes from that fact that you can’t go anywhere. Museums, gyms, schools, cinemas and libraries are all closed. Your instinct is to hunker down with the wider family, but all the advice is to stay away from the older generation, who are the most vulnerable to infection. You can’t gather round those who, like Giovanna, are ill. Not even her ailing husband is allowed close to her. You can’t go to church because they, too, are now closed. I would like to head to my mother-in-law’s house in the hills, but we’re not allowed out of the city.
It’s amazing how quickly you become used to new habits: not getting in the lift with other people or standing well apart in a queue (normally we’re bunched tight to foil the queue-bargers). When you ask a shopkeeper for a loaf of bread, they put it on the counter then step away. You pick it up, pay and step away. They put your change out and move back as you move forward. You feel like repelling magnets.
Some friends are fretful, washing their hands every half-hour or putting on surgical gloves to open doors. It’s hard not to begin to doubt your own sanity and wonder whether it’s rational to be following all these restrictions and rituals.
Then, last Wednesday night, another emergency decree ramped up the restrictions: all shops, except chemists and food stores, were ordered to remain closed. If you want to leave the house, you now have to print off a document to explain to police your timing, destination and motive.
In some ways it feels a little as you might imagine the Middle Ages. It’s as if we’re inside a city with metaphorical walls where rumours abound: that a friend, Marco, has a rasping cough; that politician Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive; that our kids will have to attend school throughout Italy’s baking summer. And Parma feels medieval because it is so quiet. I’ve never known it so safe to cycle around an Italian city. It’s as if the cars, as well as the humans, are keeping their distance.
So everything feels softer somehow. I never knew there was someone in the next block of flats who played the guitar. You can hear them strumming late at night. The natural world – all the turtle doves and cherry blossom – seems brighter or emboldened. That quietness extends to the football. Watching Juventus v Inter Milan the other night (before Serie A, too, was suspended) you could hear, in the absence of the crowds, almost everything from the actual game: the laces on leather, the players’ groans, shouts and insults. It made them seem mortal, like Sunday league players. Now, of course, several players – Juventus’s Daniele Rugani and the former Southampton (now Sampdoria) striker Manolo Gabbiadini – have tested positive.
What’s intriguing is that all the adjectives you might normally use to describe Italy (sociable, excitable, chaotic, undisciplined, polemical, fun and – despite all its troubles – somehow optimistic) have become redundant. It feels completely the opposite: isolated, calm, orderly, obedient, cowed, dour and pessimistic. It’s as if the country has suddenly discovered a different, maybe deeper, side. It’s a sterner, more serious place.
It’s sombre, of course, because there have now been more than 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy. There’s bafflement at the fact that the mortality rate here is (at time of writing) 7.17% compared with 0.05% in Sweden and 0.2% in Germany. We don’t understand why we’ve got it so bad, whether it’s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56.
There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a moratorium on mortgage payments, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country’s cassa integrazione) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated €25bn.
The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy’s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before – 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy’s biggest banks – Intesa and Unicredit – saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank offered no assistance to the country. The response from Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. “We need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,” he seethed.
Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I’m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi’s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma’s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: “Italy will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.”
So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the “silly Eye-ties” had messed things up again. “They’ll never follow the rules,” said some.
Prejudices about Italy – assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus – meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for “draconian” measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record.
From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world’s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes.
Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy’s literary canon – Alessandro Manzoni’s The Betrothed and Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy’s lead – closing schools, universities and sports events – we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated.
Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there’s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom.
We’re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise.
Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we’re shamelessly giving them domestic chores. They’re cleaning the fridge and the windows, mopping the floors and hanging out laundry. I’m also setting them daily challenges with a didactic dad’s earnestness: if they want to watch TV they have to learn the Nato phonetic alphabet (three passes), the names and dates of the Plantagenet monarchs (two passes), how to tie knots (three passes) or a Shakespeare soliloquy (only one pass). I’m learning quite a lot myself.
But you do wonder what’s going through their minds. Quite apart from the fear, they’re dealing with disappointments which, at their age, must seem huge. Benedetta had won, along with her dance troupe, an international ballet competition, the prize for which was to dance in New York in April. That won’t now happen. Emma, Mozart-obsessed, was due to go with her grandmother to the opera house in Giuseppe Verdi’s birthplace, Busseto, to see The Marriage of Figaro. That, too, has been cancelled. She has started playing melancholic Chopin instead of playful Mozart. Leonardo, like me, just longs to be able to play football again. In our manic matches of indoor one-aside, we’ve accidentally pruned the Victoria spiderworts and smashed the odd lightbulb.
They’re finding new passions too. They love playing euchre and blackjack, betting with matchsticks. Leo is teaching himself Spanish and now calls me el padre or hombre. Benedetta is sewing, she says from behind her bedroom door, a suit jacket. Emma is pretending to get fit. It’s all fairly wholesome in a Waltons kind of way. But they are, like us, getting cabin fever. We don’t know when this is going to end or what the outside world will look like when it does.
There have been eight deaths so far in Parma and, we assume, there will be many more. Parma is a small city. With more than 518 cases, almost everyone has a friend or friend-of-a-friend who is ill. It’s less important, perhaps, but many businesses, too, will go under.
Everyone is trying to be resilient. Children across the country are hanging out paintings on balconies saying andrà tutto bene (everything will be fine). There have been many goosebump moments, like the spontaneous singing of whole streets, the voices joining in complex harmonies through the open windows. There have been laughs: one Roman market stallholder wore a wide, plywood doughnut to guarantee personal distance. But it feels like gallows humour and the songs sound mournful.
Since we’ve been in lockdown, spring has erupted. You can see pinky-white bursts of magnolias lining the empty roads. Daises, primroses and dandelions are suddenly brightening the grass. It even smells like spring. The Parma air is, for once, so clean you can see the snow-capped Apennines from my study. It only makes you keener to get out.
But until this emergency lockdown ends, we will – except for rare excursions – experience the world like prisoners, from the windows of our cells.

Universities Scotland has said in a statement that the country’s higher education institutions will remain open – subject to expert advice – but that teaching and assessments will shift online.
Universities have no plans to close. The way that universities deliver their teaching and other services will change over the coming weeks, in light of new advice, and to recognise that students may wish to work from home, in the UK or overseas. 
Universities will not close as they have commitments to students, including those who live on campus. Many research facilities must run around the clock and student support and IT infrastructure systems require continuous attention.
Now that the UK has moved into the ‘delay’ phase of the outbreak, many universities will start to transition to online learning and assessment for students in subjects where this is possible. They will offer revised guidance for staff who may need to work remotely.
The precise pace of this transition will vary by institution, reflecting different term dates and other factors. As large institutions, which educate and employ many thousands of people, it is sensible that we are responsive to this outbreak, in a manner that is consistent with public health advice.

French president Emmanuel Macron has said the government had no option but to impose stricter measures to tackle the coronavirus, but that the country would get through the crisis if it acted responsibly.
“I am the guarantor of the health of our citizens and also the democratic life of our country,” he said, defending his decision to hold local elections – which have been postponed in the UK.
“We will overcome this crisis by being responsible together and for each other,” he said, after casting his vote in northern France.
Macron said the decision to close shops and restaurants needed to be made because too many people were being too lax in how they protected themselves from the virus. 
Meanwhile, a reader in the Rhône valley, in the south of France, has been in touch to say voters have been asked to bring their own pens to the polling stations.

The Scottish government is not planning to ask over-70’s to self-isolate, contrary to the UK government.
Instead, elderly people in Scotland will be asked to reduce social contact.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish health secretary confirmed the plans after UK health secretary Hancock said potential future measures to force over-70s to stay at home were a “very big ask”, but said it would be for their own “self-protection”.
Asked about whether Scotland would follow suit, Freeman said: 
The additional measures that we’ve always talked about are about reducing contact for those over 70 and in their eighties, asking them to reduce their social contact because they are one of the groups who are most at risk of this virus making them seriously ill.
The other group is people who have underlying health conditions whose immune system is suppressed. It’s not isolation, it’s asking them to reduce social contact.
We don’t want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them. What were saying to them is, reduce your contact.
The news of the potential isolation of elderly people was briefed anonymously to journalists overnight and has led to criticism over how the UK government is communicating policies and advice. 
Overnight anonymous briefings to Sunday journalists are common, but there have been calls for a new approach in light of the pandemic.
Asked about how the news emerged, Freeman said: 
It’s not how we would do it. Government’s should be coming and explaining these things really clearly.
Overnight briefing, background briefing, unattributed sources is not the way to ensure that the public are understanding what we are trying to do and our working with us to do that.
Giving clear and consistent information to public at the right time on #coronavirus is vital. Governments’ media strategies must reflect the importance of that. This is not a run of the mill political issue. @scotgov will set out advice to the public in an orderly manner.

Urgent efforts to repatriate 30,000 British tourists from ski resorts in France are under way amid warnings of “widespread failures” in the travel sector in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
French mountains resorts closed at midnight on Saturday just hours after tens of thousands had landed for their annual holiday in the snow.
Leading ski and summer activity holiday company Neilson has called for the government to step in with “emergency measures”.
There were reports of chaos and confusion across the Alps with one source saying local police had taken the French government’s message into their own hands and going round hotels and restaurants telling marooned Britons to go home immediately.
Diane Palumbo, sales and marketing director at SkiWorld, said she had 900 customers across the Alps and they had been in talks with all the key resorts on Friday to warn them that if they were to close not to do so on Saturday when a fresh influx of tourists were scheduled to arrive.
“We are getting over our anger. It was literally not until 10pm last night that we were confident of the information we were receiving. The same people who had assured us on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday that they would remain open, have now all closed,” she said.
The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, announced that the country must “close all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops” from midnight.
Although ski-resorts were not specifically listed, the ski industry in the UK believe they are all closing.
One of the biggest operators, Inghams, said “as a responsible tour operator” it would not be operating any more holidays to French resorts for the rest of the season and advised those who were due to go out on Sunday to abandon plans.
Palumbo said all those who had booked through an ATOL backed agent would get their money back but that small- to medium-sized tour operators and travel companies could go bust.
“The airlines are very quick to ask for help from the government but this is a massive flow of people which will costs the industry millions. If the government does not step in travel companies will start to fail because the cost of repatriation will be enormous,” she said.
David Taylor, chief executive of Neilson holidays, said it was “hugely disappointed” that it received such short notice on the closures. He called for emergency measures for the sector.
With the Covid-19 crisis likely to last several months, we are asking the government to consider emergency measures specifically targeted at the travel and leisure sector to deliver immediate relief and help avoid widespread failures.
This remains an isolated issue on 2020 departures only and we are confident that next year will see a healthy recovery provided a swathe of relief measures recommended to the government are enacted.
Separately Ryanair was frantically working to repatriate customers stranded in Spain after the country was thrown into lockdown arrangements. It has also cancelled all flights to and from Poland.
“Ryanair Group Airlines (including Buzz and Lauda) has been forced to severely reduce flights to/from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from 24.00 Sun 15 Mar until 24.00 Thurs 19 Mar,” it said in a statement.
It added it was “contacting all affected customers by email to advise them of their options and we urge customs not to call us”.
Earlier, it announced all flights “to and from Poland have been cancelled from midnight on Saturday to midnight on 31 March”.

Health minister Nadine Dorries has reassured people panic-buying toilet roll that she has not run out of the bathroom essential during her week in self-isolation.
However, it was unclear how many rolls she had in her house when her period of quarantine began after she tested positive earlier this week. 
Having lived through #Coronavirus can I assure everyone that at no time during the seven days we were in isolation at home did we even once have to face a secondary crisis and run out of loo roll. 🧻
A piece authored by the novelist has been published n the Times (paywall) this morning, documenting the Tory MP’s coronavirus ordeal.
I will always remember how I felt the moment I was told that I had tested positive for the coronavirus — not least because it was the very last thing I was expecting to hear.
A diagnosis would make no difference to how I behaved or dealt with my symptoms. But I had my 84-year-old mother staying with me for a few weeks and, despite the fact that she has survived polio, rheumatic fever, major heart surgery and a world war, she is not in the best of health.
The community nursing team were waiting for me as I drove into a Covid-19 testing centre on a local industrial estate. It resembled the tyre-change bay at my local garage.
Unlike with my situation, we know exactly where [her mother] caught it from and the irony is, despite her having had major surgery to replace the valves in her heart damaged by childhood illness, despite her pacemaker and breathlessness, her lifetime of smoking, hard work in her early years and poor diet, she had much milder symptoms than me.

G7 leaders will discuss the importance of a coordinated response to the impact of coronavirus on the global economy, according to No 10 following a phone conversation between Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe.
A Downing Street spokesperson said:
The prime minister spoke to Japanese prime minister Abe about the coronavirus pandemic.
The leaders updated each other on their countries’ efforts to curb the spread of the virus. The prime minister stressed the importance the UK is placing on taking a science-led approach when deciding what measures to implement.
The prime minister and prime minister Abe agreed on the importance of international coordination to tackle the virus and its wider impact, particularly on the global economy, and they looked forward to the call between G7 leaders to discuss this.
The prime minster and prime minister Abe also discussed the UK and Japan’s efforts to combat climate change ahead of COP26 in Glasgow later this year.

Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government.
The Waqf at Masjid al-Aqsa has decided to temporarily close the Musallah al-Qibli, Dome of the Rock and all covered prayer areas at the mosque as a precautionary measure.

People in some states could face hefty fines if they do not comply with new government restrictions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, with the prime minister announcing strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days. 
Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus.
The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening.
A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman – a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge – died on Saturday.
NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57.
Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61.
Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people.
State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made.
Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against “static, non-essential” mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday, although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger “widescale” closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces.
“We will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,” Morrison said.
“All people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days.
“Further, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.”
Morrison said that – until now – self-isolation had been a “voluntary arrangement” with “no potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement”.
“That will change,” he said, although penalties would be “a matter for the states and territories”.
“If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.”
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state’s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made.
Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday’s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved.
But she said it would be difficult to monitor “every situation” and the government would be relying on “public goodwill” to ensure the rules were followed and the government would “prefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation”.
“If you’re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,” Berejiklian said.
The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000.
“To date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,” she said.
The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included “severe fines”, for people who breached the self-isolation rules.
By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing.
“The states and territories … are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.”
Morrison said the government’s national information campaign “is running and it will be available to all Australians” but claimed that social distancing was “pretty straightforward”.
He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean “ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they’re close family and friends”. “It’s all commonsense.”
For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them.
“If we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,” he said.
Morrison foreshadowed that there “will be further intrusions, further restrictions on people’s movement and their behaviour” in future in response to changes in medical advice.
The first of these will be new protocols for visiting aged care facilities, he said, with further work to be done to protect remote communities in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that school closures are regarded as inevitable, prompting many schools and universities to prepare for shutdowns.
But Morrison said there were “very good reasons” against moving to “broadscale closures of schools” at this point.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, schools should stay open at this time because taking children out may expose others to risk and would “put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community”, he said. “The states and territories are not moving in that direction.”
The issue will be revisited at meetings of the national cabinet on Tuesday and Friday, although individual schools in Victoria and NSW have been allowed to close “based on the cases presented there in the circumstances that exist in those communities”, he said.
Earlier on Sunday Murphy and the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that as advice changes, measures might escalate to include general lockdowns.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” Murphy told ABC’s Insiders. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
Labor has criticised the government for the slow pace of rolling out a national information campaign, and on Sunday the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for further support for the aviation sector, which missed out on funding in the $1bn regional and community fund.
“While these measures are necessary for public health, the federal government must urgently address the significant consequences for our aviation sector,” she said.
“With conditions changing rapidly and no end in sight, the federal government must urgently provide all necessary support to ensure Australia has a vibrant aviation sector once the coronavirus outbreak has passed.”"

Even at their most effective – and draconian – containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.
About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials in April.
This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.
But there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus – flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk – vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on “prototype” pathogens. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.
Coronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.
Sars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars – hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung – the same type of receptor in both cases – allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.
All vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.
Traditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy – the one that Novavax is using, for example – constructs a “recombinant” vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast – forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another Boston company, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.
Cepi’s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (£3.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. “Our experience with vaccine development is that you can’t anticipate where you’re going to stumble,” says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way.
Clinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there’s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. “Not all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,” says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and is collaborating with Cepi over a Covid-19 vaccine.
There are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they’re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can’t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material – RNA or DNA – has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: “While there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it’s really important not to take shortcuts.”
An illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.
It’s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November – an impossible deadline. “Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That’s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.
In the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it’s going to be needed in vast quantities – and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don’t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don’t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.
Once a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. “Getting a vaccine that’s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what’s needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.”
The problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk – including children and pregnant women – with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.
Because pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India – a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world – not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.
Outside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes – leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: “The question is, what will happen in a situation where you’ve got national emergencies going on?”
This is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, “will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available”. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating – like flu – and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible. To repeat the sage advice: wash your hands."

Paul Karp","Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says school closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food are ‘premature’ at the moment


Sun 15 Mar 2020 02.51 GMT


First published on Sun 15 Mar 2020 01.13 GMT


School closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food to prepare for coronavirus self-isolation are “premature” for the general population, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, have said, though all options are on the table.
Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin “practising” to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly.
Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required.
Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight’s worth of food.
Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled.
Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports “or things of that nature”.
On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government’s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a “six-month window” although it “might be longer”.
Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” he said. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
“There are no options that are off the table,” Hunt said. “The paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.”
Murphy said authorities were “strongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call ‘social distancing’.
“So that’s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact … not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.”
Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more “may well change” but Australia, which he said had “only 250 cases”, was still “ahead of the curve”.
“If you’re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should … [exercise] more social distancing,” he said, and “avoid things that aren’t essential”.
Murphy said for others the risk of attending public places with fewer than 500 people, such as a cinema, was still at this stage “relatively low” and at the moment authorities were not recommending people stop taking the train. As case numbers increase, the medical advice will respond to recommend greater social distancing, he said.
“I think the gym is fine but everybody at the moment needs to practise very good hygiene.
“If you’re going to the gym, I would be very focused on hand washing, using hand sanitisers, all of those social distancing, good hygiene measures, we want everybody in the community to start practising those.”
Asked about the Victorian chief medical officer’s suggestion people should stockpile a fortnight’s worth of food, Murphy replied it was “a little bit premature at the moment”.
“For most people we don’t want to encourage major panic buying at the moment – we’ve seen that with the supermarket chains. But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.”
Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice.
He said governments did not want to “move too early” because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and “taking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains”.
Murphy said there was “no question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they’ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time”. “So you don’t want to move too early.”
Murphy said there were “very few reports of symptomatic infection in children” and authorities don’t know “whether children are getting infected but just don’t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they’re not getting infected”. “The former is probably more likely.”
Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity.
Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they’re feeling unwell.
Murphy said Australian authorities define “close contact” – which requires self-isolation – as “someone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before”.
He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are “very, very unlikely to have been infectious”.
On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was “aghast” at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response.
Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy’s advice on hand shaking was “inconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying” and argued there is “no coherent advice” about whether schools should open from Monday.
Bowtell said the government appeared to “have no plan” for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was “imperative” to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals.
Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday.
Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an “abundance of caution” and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined.
Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined “the relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March”, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday’s meeting.
On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a “national cabinet” made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday.
So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn.
The Morrison government has set up a new coronavirus business unit in the Treasury to support business confidence, employment and business continuity."

The international travel industry faces a widespread shutdown over coronavirus fears after airlines announced new flight reductions and more countries introduced travel bans and isolation requirements.
Travel businesses were hit with multiple doses of bad news on Saturday and Sunday, with the US expanding its Europe travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, a number of South American countries bringing in flight restrictions and Australia joining New Zealand in requiring all people entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days.
American Airlines, the second biggest in the world, said on Saturday that it would start implementing a phased suspension of nearly all long-haul international flights from Monday, amid reduced demand and travel restrictions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
The cruise industry also suffered another setback when two ships were placed in quarantine in Chile after an elderly British man aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced on Saturday.
The US government said on Saturday that it would “immediately” begin working on ways to help the coronavirus-hit aviation and cruise industries as they scramble to stem losses and protect jobs.
The crisis facing the industry has been accelerated by the latest extension of the US ban on incoming travel, with US vice-president Mike Pence announcing at the White House on Saturday that British and Irish travellers would also be barred from entering the US for 30 days.
At the same press conference, Donald Trump revealed that he had taken a test for the virus, with the White House later revealing that he had proved negative.
In Spain, the wife of prime minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive as her husband formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus. Spain is now the fourth-worst affected country in the world after it recorded more deaths to take the total to 196. Sánchez said the country would be placed in lockdown for two weeks and ordered people to stay at home unless they had to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital.
The outbreak also worsened in the UK on Saturday with the total of deaths nearly doubling from 11 to 21 amid continued controversy about whether the government’s policy aimed at creating “herd immunity” from the disease would work or not.
Around the world, varying measures of control continued to be imposed on populations from the Philippines, where the capital Manila was in the process of being sealed off, to Argentina where flights from countries badly hit by the virus have been halted.
The prospect of a shattering blow for the airline industry was foreshadowed by the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, as he announced that all international passenger arrivals from midnight Sunday would be legally required to self-isolate for 14 days.
The flights would dry up “very, very quickly”, he said, and set up serious concerns for the country’s $3.5bn cruise industry by adding that passenger ships from foreign ports would be banned for an initial 30 days.
Even before the new curbs were announced, the chief executive of British Airways told staff that the airline was in a “fight for survival”.
US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government would “immediately” start working with Congress to support the afflicted industries.
The US restrictions on travel to the UK and Ireland will begin on Monday at midnight, Pence said. Most non-US citizens who have been in those countries within the last 14 days will be barred from entering America. The restrictions do not bar flights to and from the US, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel.
As the curbs were revealed, United and Delta airlines said they would start cutting flights to the UK and Southwest, one of the few US airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was “seriously considering” cutting flights.
United said it would suspend flights to London from Houston and Denver starting Monday. The airline expects to fly three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin through the end of April.
United said it would give a credit for the value of the ticket for any customer whose international travel is disrupted by more than six hours because of schedule changes resulting from government restrictions. Customers who do not use the credit for 12 months will get a refund.
Between 16 March and 6 May, American will reduce its international capacity by 75% on a year-over-year basis, it said in a statement, adding that the changes will result in the airline parking nearly its entire widebody fleet. The airline also anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20% on a year-over-year basis. Domestic capacity for the month of May will be reduced by 30%, the company added.
The US Chamber of Commerce on Friday called on the government to “turn next to a package to assist impacted employers ... No business should go bankrupt because of a temporary loss in revenue as a result of the coronavirus.”
In Europe, the situation for the sector was increasingly dire.
Norwegian Air, which has built up large debts to establish itself as a low-cost transatlantic operator, said on Saturday that it had “weeks not months” to avert collapse.
KLM, the Dutch subsidiary of Air France-KLM, plans to slash up to 2,000 jobs, cut working hours by one-third for its entire staff and ask for government support.
German flagship carrier Lufthansa said on Friday it was considering a request for state aid.
In Bolivia, a ban on direct flights to and from Europe went into effect on Saturday. Travellers from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain are also banned from entry.
Panama banned flights from Asia, one day after blocking flights from Europe.
Chile, meanwhile, has quarantined more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced Saturday.
The 85-year-old man, who is reportedly in good condition in a hospital in the city of Coyhaique, showed symptoms of the virus after getting off the Silver Explorer ship in the far southern port of Caleta Tortel, 2,400 kilometres (1,500 miles) from Santiago.
The other ship, the Azmara Pursuit was currently near the port of Chacabuco after authorities banned it from landing passengers there, on grounds that it was carrying suspected cases of the coronavirus.

Schools will remain open nationally despite escalating government restrictions on other aspects of life such as travel due to the spread of the coronavirus, but new social distancing measures have been announced for schools in New South Wales. 
The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure.
“Schools have been a focus of the community and the government as the impacts of the coronavirus have developed globally,” Scott said.
“From Monday onwards I expect assemblies and substantial gatherings to be cancelled, along with all excursions.”
All interschool arts and sports events have also been cancelled.
But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said widespread school closures would not take place, despite a raft of other new measures to contain the spread of the virus.
Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great.
“People are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
“As the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate.
“When you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.”
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources.
Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown.
Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. 
The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said.
I have had repeated contacts from parents that school bathrooms have no soap. Also that the taps are spring loaded and have to held on with one hand while the other is under it. This makes it impossible to wash hands as directed. This is normal in school student bathrooms.
Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the “opportune public health decision” with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later.
“Given that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,” one source said.
Schools are expected to introduce new social distancing measures this week, including scrapping school assemblies, school plays and concerts and reducing interschool activities.
The senior vice-president of the NSW Teachers’ Federation, Amber Flohm, said teachers had the technology available to deliver online learning but many children could be disadvantaged if they didn’t have access to computers and the internet.
“We are not doctors, we’re teachers, and so the decision will be for them and the department of education will respond accordingly,” Flohm said.
“There will be an equity issue. I would argue a lot of kids don’t have laptops. Children might have mobile phones but if we’re talking about delivering the curriculum, significant resources would need to be provided for teachers and students.”
Flohm dismissed a claim by the Greens MP David Shoebridge that not all schools provided soap for children to wash their hands.
“It is my understanding that all public schools have soap and access to water in their bathrooms … that’s not what we have heard from teachers.”
The former Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps called for schools to be immediately shut down despite the disruption to medical personnel who would have to care for children.
Phelps, a Sydney GP, also said all children should be tested for a fever when arriving at school if schools are kept open.
“It’s inevitable in the middle of an uncontrolled epidemic that the schools will be closed,” Phelps said. “It’s just a matter of when.
“Unless the government has convincing evidence that the schools can safely be kept open, that should be now.”"

Kim Willsher","French minister says patients should take paracetamol rather than ibuprofen or cortisone

First published on Sat 14 Mar 2020 15.47 GMT


French authorities have warned that widely used over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen the coronavirus.
The country’s health minister, Olivier Véran, who is a qualified doctor and neurologist, tweeted on Saturday: “The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone … ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”
Health officials point out that anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system.
The health ministry added that patients should choose paracetamol because “it will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation”.
French patients have been forced to consult pharmacies since mid-January if they want to buy popular painkillers, including ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin, to be reminded of the risks.
Jean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, told RTL radio: “Anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of complications when there is a fever or infection.”
The French health ministry announced on Friday evening that the number of coronavirus case in the country had increased by 800 in 24 hours. Véran said there were 3,661 confirmed cases that had lead to 79 deaths. Of the sick, 154 people are in intensive care.
Véran said in his daily briefing that the evolution and spread of the virus was “rapid and real”, but that 98% of those who had tested positive had recovered.
The Eiffel Tower, Château de Versailles, Louvre, Musée d’Orsay and Centre Pompidou are among the public attractions that have closed. The archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, said there would be no Sunday masses held in churches in the Paris region.
About 400 gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, gathered in Paris for “Act 70”, the 70th consecutive Saturday of protests since November 2018. An authorised march from Montparnasse station to Bercy, where the economy ministry is situated, is expected to go ahead. Public gatherings of more than 100 people have been banned in France, but it has been reported that demonstrations are exempt.
Schools closed across the country after lessons on Saturday, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home. The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus by internet. “This coming period is not one in which the youngsters don’t have to work,” he told BFMTV."

The acid test of Trump's maverick leadership has come – can he save himself?
","
David Smith in Washington","The president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been ‘haphazard’, from a cascade of false statements to a public address that fueled anxiety


Sun 15 Mar 2020 06.00 GMT


With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America.
Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making.
Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens – household names in America – will provide “drive-thru” testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance.
This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing.
The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump’s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump’s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk.
The acid test of Trump’s maverick leadership has finally come.
His response so far has been “haphazard”, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “When you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.”
Trump’s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. His discomfort on this topic was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it.
“Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” he said. “I don’t know anything about it.”
Trump’s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.
Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a “Keep America Great Again” cap, boasting of his “natural ability” to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.
On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers’ estimation, an unmitigated disaster, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.
Then came Friday’s rose garden reset. Trump declared a national emergency that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.
His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.
“This day should be an inspiration to every American,” he said, “because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing an all-of-America approach.
“Mr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China … throughout this process, Mr President, you’ve put the health of America first.”
It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?
There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points – its biggest point gain ever.
Furthermore, the are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump’s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, said: “I think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China]. The rollout of the kits and the testing was a step backwards but now they seem to be getting their footing back.”
His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk
Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: “He gets mixed reviews. His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk. Where he got good reviews lies in the government’s overall approach.”
Whalen noted that California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship.
Newsom told reporters: “We had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: ‘We’re gonna do the right thing’ and ‘You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise’. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.”
Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November’s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting.
It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush’s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Whalen said: “The question is how does he handle this as on a personal level. For Bush, the problem with Katrina wasn’t the federal response but Bush not getting out of the plane, not showing the personal touch. Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he’d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief.
“The economy is his trump card at all times. There are people who say: ‘I may not care for the tweets or his bombastic bluster but I’m making money while he’s in office.’ But now people will get their monthly statement and ask: ‘What happened to 10% of my portfolio?’”"

The French prime minister announced the closure of cafes, restaurants and all public places “non-essential” to public life, including cinemas and discos, from midnight on Saturday . Edouard Philippe said: “We must absolutely limit movement, meetings and contacts.” But he allowed food shops, tobacconists, banks and public transport to remain open.
French authorities also warned that widely used over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen the coronavirus, as the number of cases across the country jumped to 4,480. There have been 91 deaths, and France is one of several countries across Europe that have gone into lockdown.
Schools closed after final lessons last week, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home, where the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has warned they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus online. Authorities have banned gatherings of more than 100 people and shut down attractions including the Eiffel Tower, the palace of Versailles, the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay. In the Paris region, there will be no Sunday masses.
The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the evolution and spread of the virus was “rapid and real”, but added that about 98% of those who test positive for the virus do recover. 
Health officials point out that anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system. The health ministry added that patients should choose paracetamol because “it will reduce the fever without counter-attacking the inflammation”. Kim Willsher
The number of imported coronavirus cases now exceeds locally transmitted new infections for the first time, data from China’s national health commission shows. On Friday it had 11 new cases, but seven were brought in by travellers from the US, Italy and Saudi Arabia, and only four were transmitted inside the country. At least one of these was a US-based Chinese citizen, who reportedly returned home in search of medical treatment after requests for a test were turned down in Massachusetts, where she lived.
Beijing has been providing free treatment as part of its effort to halt the spread of the virus. But apparently in anticipation of more people arriving from abroad with the disease, it has drawn up a policy that will require most to pay for their own care. Emma Graham-Harrison
The Spanish government declared a state of emergency on Saturday, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to leave their homes only if they needed to buy food, medicine, or go to work or hospital.
The lockdown, which will begin on Monday, comes after schools across the country were closed for a fortnight and the regional governments of Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias ordered the closure of all non-essential shops. The only businesses permitted to remain open are supermarkets, bakeries, butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers, petrol stations, pharmacies, tobacconists and newspaper kiosks.
Madrid’s city council announced the closure of all public parks and gardens to prevent large concentrations of people, while Seville, Granada and Córdoba cancelled their Holy Week celebrations. The Catalan president, Quim Torra, announced plans to close off the north-eastern region and called on the central government to assist by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways.
After Italy, Spain is the European country most affected by the coronavirus, and has confirmed 6,391 cases and 196 deaths.
Jet2, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, Málaga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.
The socialist-led government of prime minister Pedro Sánchez, whose wife tested positive for Covid-19 last night, has been fiercely criticised for its delay in rolling out robust measures to fight the virus and for allowing huge rallies across the country last Sunday to mark International Women’s Day. A state of emergency has not been declared since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers’ strike. It will initially apply for two weeks. Sam Jones
Fears are growing about the spread of the virus in the world’s second-most populous country after it recorded its second death.
India has an impressive record in tackling infectious diseases, including defeating polio, and in 2009 curbing the swine flu pandemic. But it also has a stretched and uneven public health system.
The latest victim, a 68-year-old woman, caught the virus from her son after he travelled to Italy and Switzerland. He works at a large plant and may have been in contact with up to 1,500 people.
With 102 cases confirmed, the New Delhi government has invoked the Epidemic Act, which allows authorities to force people into isolation, and has brought in laws to prevent hoarding of hand sanitisers.
In many states, social life is being curbed, with gyms, pools, cinemas and theatres closed, and weddings, engagements and birthday parties banned in southern Karnataka. Emma Graham-Harrison "

Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. Speaking after a seven-hour cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, whose wife has tested positive for the virus, said “extraordinary decisions” needed to be taken as Spain grappled with a “health, social and economic crisis”.
The international travel industry faces a widespread shutdown after airlines announced new flight reductions and more countries introduced travel bans and isolation requirements. Travel businesses were hit with multiple doses of bad news, with the US expanding its Europe travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, a number of South American countries bringing in flight restrictions and Australia joining New Zealand in requiring all people entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days. American Airlines, the second biggest in the world, said on Saturday that it would start implementing a phased suspension of nearly all long-haul international flights from Monday.
All people arriving in Australia will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and cruise ship arrivals will be banned for at least 30 days, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced. Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people. The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing.
The coronavirus death toll in the UK nearly doubled in just 24 hours, with the number of confirmed cases of the disease surging by hundreds. Ten more patients, all of whom had underlying health conditions, died after contracting the virus – bringing the total fatalities in the country so far from 11 to 21.
Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus as he announced new measures to tackle the crisis, including expanding the existing US travel ban to cover the UK and Ireland. In a briefing at the White House on Saturday, the president confirmed he had taken a test for the virus after coming into contact with a Brazilian government official last week in Florida who later tested positive for the disease. The president’s physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement on Saturday evening that Trump’s test was negative.
About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create a coronavirus vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates that they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials in April. But even if those trials go well, there are many barriers to widespread introduction of a vaccine.
The US is on course to be severely ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak due to a delayed and dysfunctional testing regime and misleading messaging from the Trump administration, public health experts have warned. There are more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the US, but many believe the actual number of infected Americans is certain to be far higher, with the true toll obscured by a calamitous lack of testing. In the period from last Sunday until Wednesday morning, the Centers for Disease Control tested just 77 people in the US. By stark comparison the Utah Jazz basketball team alone managed to test 58 people as the NBA, along with scores of schools, Broadway shows and various other cultural and sporting events were shut down. Even in Washington state, where 31 people have died, health officials have had to ration test kits.
As of today 73,968 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher."

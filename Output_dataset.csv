The Morrison government only engaged a creative agency for its national public health campaign about coronavirus on 3 March, more than a month after the first case of the disease was reported in Australia.
According to the contract notice on AusTender, the health department engaged Carbon Media to provide creative services for the Covid-19 campaign on 3 March.
A spokesman for the health minister Greg Hunt defended the timeline, telling Guardian Australia the department “had access to creative services from a range of sources, both internal and external, well before Carbon Media was engaged” but conceded the contract for the national campaign began on 3 March.
Labor has seized on the revelation to step up its criticism that the Morrison government was too slow to educate the public about preventing the spread of coronavirus through hygiene and social distancing measures.
On Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia will require all international arrivals in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days and is now encouraging social distancing for others. The escalation comes on top of a recommendation that from Monday all non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled.
The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable.
The $407,700 Carbon Media contract is due to run until 30 June and was awarded by limited tender, subject to the exemption on open tenders for government advertising contracts.
Carbon Media has numerous other contracts with the health department including for seasonal influenza communications and childhood immunisation.
Labor’s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, told Guardian Australia: “Time will tell whether this is in an effective advertising campaign, but Labor questions why it took the government over two months to commence an advertising campaign to provide the most basic public health information on Covid-19.
“They should be doing more, sooner.”
The coronavirus ads, which were rolled out on Saturday, direct Australians to visit health.gov.au to access up-to-date advice:
Another version of the ad urges people who have been overseas or had contact with people with coronavirus to call ahead before visiting the doctor and stay home if the illness is mild:
Australians are directed to cough or sneeze into their arm or a tissue, and to wash their hands regularly:
On Wednesday Hunt announced the $30m ad campaign as part of the $2.4bn health response to the coronavirus.
So far, the health department has paid $2.3m to Mediabrands Australia for the media buy for the campaign, and $56,375 to Snapcracker Research and Strategy for concept testing for the campaign. Those contracts run from 12 March and 4 March.
The department has paid $17,270 to Ansible Pty Ltd to develop a mobile application, although it is unclear if the contract relates to development of a new coronavirus app.
At a press conference on Sunday Bowen said Labor welcomed the fact the advertising campaign has started in earnest.
“I have made the point consistently that the public information has not always been clear and consistent,” he said.
Bowen said the campaign “needs to be a nationally coordinated, fully integrated campaign to allay misinformation on social media” and should also “make people’s obligations for self-isolation very clear”.
On 11 March Hunt defended the pace of rolling out ads by noting the government had already started using signage at airports to communicate about measures to combat coronavirus.
“In addition, we’ll be focusing on online, electronic media and messages to the home to make sure that people have as many avenues [to receive information] as possible,” he said.
Hunt’s spokesman said the government had run “a range of messages and advertising, particularly targeted at the Chinese community and international travellers as was the original need in the early phases of the outbreak”.
“The public has been provided with the latest developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak through nearly daily press conferences, media releases, updates on the department’s website and social media channels.”
“Multiple fact sheets and communiques have been posted on the website and distributed to key stakeholders and industries to address their specific requirements.”"

People in some states could face hefty fines if they do not comply with new government restrictions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, with the prime minister announcing strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days. 
Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus.
The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening.
A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman – a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge – died on Saturday.
NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57.
Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61.
Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people.
State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made.
Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against “static, non-essential” mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday, although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger “widescale” closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces.
“We will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,” Morrison said.
“All people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days.
“Further, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.”
Morrison said that – until now – self-isolation had been a “voluntary arrangement” with “no potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement”.
“That will change,” he said, although penalties would be “a matter for the states and territories”.
“If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.”
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state’s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made.
Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday’s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved.
But she said it would be difficult to monitor “every situation” and the government would be relying on “public goodwill” to ensure the rules were followed and the government would “prefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation”.
“If you’re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,” Berejiklian said.
The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000.
“To date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,” she said.
The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included “severe fines”, for people who breached the self-isolation rules.
By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing.
“The states and territories … are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.”
Morrison said the government’s national information campaign “is running and it will be available to all Australians” but claimed that social distancing was “pretty straightforward”.
He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean “ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they’re close family and friends”. “It’s all commonsense.”
For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them.
“If we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,” he said.
Morrison foreshadowed that there “will be further intrusions, further restrictions on people’s movement and their behaviour” in future in response to changes in medical advice.
The first of these will be new protocols for visiting aged care facilities, he said, with further work to be done to protect remote communities in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that school closures are regarded as inevitable, prompting many schools and universities to prepare for shutdowns.
But Morrison said there were “very good reasons” against moving to “broadscale closures of schools” at this point.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, schools should stay open at this time because taking children out may expose others to risk and would “put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community”, he said. “The states and territories are not moving in that direction.”
The issue will be revisited at meetings of the national cabinet on Tuesday and Friday, although individual schools in Victoria and NSW have been allowed to close “based on the cases presented there in the circumstances that exist in those communities”, he said.
Earlier on Sunday Murphy and the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that as advice changes, measures might escalate to include general lockdowns.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” Murphy told ABC’s Insiders. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
Labor has criticised the government for the slow pace of rolling out a national information campaign, and on Sunday the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for further support for the aviation sector, which missed out on funding in the $1bn regional and community fund.
“While these measures are necessary for public health, the federal government must urgently address the significant consequences for our aviation sector,” she said.
“With conditions changing rapidly and no end in sight, the federal government must urgently provide all necessary support to ensure Australia has a vibrant aviation sector once the coronavirus outbreak has passed.”"

","Scott Morrison says widespread closures ‘anti-intuitive’ as state cancels excursions, assemblies, concerts and travel• Coronavirus latest updates: all arrivals in Australia must self-isolate for 14 days, says PM
The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure.
“Schools have been a focus of the community and the government as the impacts of the coronavirus have developed globally,” Scott said.
“From Monday onwards I expect assemblies and substantial gatherings to be cancelled, along with all excursions.”
All interschool arts and sports events have also been cancelled.
But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said widespread school closures would not take place, despite a raft of other new measures to contain the spread of the virus.
Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great.
“People are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
“As the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate.
“When you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.”
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources.
Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown.
Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. 
The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said.
I have had repeated contacts from parents that school bathrooms have no soap. Also that the taps are spring loaded and have to held on with one hand while the other is under it. This makes it impossible to wash hands as directed. This is normal in school student bathrooms.
Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the “opportune public health decision” with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later.
“Given that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,” one source said.
Schools are expected to introduce new social distancing measures this week, including scrapping school assemblies, school plays and concerts and reducing interschool activities.
The senior vice-president of the NSW Teachers’ Federation, Amber Flohm, said teachers had the technology available to deliver online learning but many children could be disadvantaged if they didn’t have access to computers and the internet.
“We are not doctors, we’re teachers, and so the decision will be for them and the department of education will respond accordingly,” Flohm said.
“There will be an equity issue. I would argue a lot of kids don’t have laptops. Children might have mobile phones but if we’re talking about delivering the curriculum, significant resources would need to be provided for teachers and students.”
Flohm dismissed a claim by the Greens MP David Shoebridge that not all schools provided soap for children to wash their hands.
“It is my understanding that all public schools have soap and access to water in their bathrooms … that’s not what we have heard from teachers.”
The former Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps called for schools to be immediately shut down despite the disruption to medical personnel who would have to care for children.
Phelps, a Sydney GP, also said all children should be tested for a fever when arriving at school if schools are kept open.
“It’s inevitable in the middle of an uncontrolled epidemic that the schools will be closed,” Phelps said. “It’s just a matter of when.
“Unless the government has convincing evidence that the schools can safely be kept open, that should be now.”"

Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great.
“People are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
“As the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate.
“When you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.”
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources.
Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown.
Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. 
The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said.
I have had repeated contacts from parents that school bathrooms have no soap. Also that the taps are spring loaded and have to held on with one hand while the other is under it. This makes it impossible to wash hands as directed. This is normal in school student bathrooms.
Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the “opportune public health decision” with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later.
“Given that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,” one source said.
Schools are expected to introduce new social distancing measures this week, including scrapping school assemblies, school plays and concerts and reducing interschool activities.
The senior vice-president of the NSW Teachers’ Federation, Amber Flohm, said teachers had the technology available to deliver online learning but many children could be disadvantaged if they didn’t have access to computers and the internet.
“We are not doctors, we’re teachers, and so the decision will be for them and the department of education will respond accordingly,” Flohm said.
“There will be an equity issue. I would argue a lot of kids don’t have laptops. Children might have mobile phones but if we’re talking about delivering the curriculum, significant resources would need to be provided for teachers and students.”
Flohm dismissed a claim by the Greens MP David Shoebridge that not all schools provided soap for children to wash their hands.
“It is my understanding that all public schools have soap and access to water in their bathrooms … that’s not what we have heard from teachers.”
The former Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps called for schools to be immediately shut down despite the disruption to medical personnel who would have to care for children.
Phelps, a Sydney GP, also said all children should be tested for a fever when arriving at school if schools are kept open.
“It’s inevitable in the middle of an uncontrolled epidemic that the schools will be closed,” Phelps said. “It’s just a matter of when.
“Unless the government has convincing evidence that the schools can safely be kept open, that should be now.”"

Write a diary, take action: Hubei residents on fighting coronavirus anxiety

Lily Kuo","As Covid-19 spreads worldwide, the people of Hubei explain how they dealt with the lockdown

In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress.
As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health.
At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn’t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent.
Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better.
Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support.
There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day.
It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can’t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live.
By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups.
It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself.
Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don’t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious.
It’s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven’t been able to concentrate on my work. I don’t absorb what I’m reading. I’m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can’t help it.
I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing.
If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help. Take advantage of this time to care for yourself and your family.
I came home from Wuhan the day before the lockdown. Like most people, I didn’t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family.
I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted.
Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn’t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people’s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much.
I feel like I am a survivor. It’s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a “lock down” diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions. Seeing other people reply has let me know that I am not alone. Everyone is in this situation. I am not special.
I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure.
Talking with friends is also really important. On the night of 6 February [when the Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang died], I spent all night reading the news on Weibo and WeChat. Like me, my friends didn’t sleep. Every update someone saw, they would immediately share.
This was the hardest time for me. There’s no way to really deal with this except to remember it. Also, in late January when the outbreak first exploded … seeing all the messages online of people asking for help and the huge gap between what was being reported in the news and what was really happening also caused a lot of mental pressure.

The acid test of Trump's maverick leadership has come – can he save himself?
","
David Smith in Washington","The president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been ‘haphazard’, from a cascade of false statements to a public address that fueled anxiety


Sun 15 Mar 2020 06.00 GMT


With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America.
Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making.
Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens – household names in America – will provide “drive-thru” testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance.
This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing.
The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump’s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump’s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk.
The acid test of Trump’s maverick leadership has finally come.
His response so far has been “haphazard”, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “When you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.”
Trump’s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. His discomfort on this topic was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it.
“Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” he said. “I don’t know anything about it.”
Trump’s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.
Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a “Keep America Great Again” cap, boasting of his “natural ability” to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.
On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers’ estimation, an unmitigated disaster, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.
Then came Friday’s rose garden reset. Trump declared a national emergency that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.
His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.
“This day should be an inspiration to every American,” he said, “because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing an all-of-America approach.
“Mr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China … throughout this process, Mr President, you’ve put the health of America first.”
It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?
There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points – its biggest point gain ever.
Furthermore, the are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump’s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, said: “I think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China]. The rollout of the kits and the testing was a step backwards but now they seem to be getting their footing back.”
His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk
Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: “He gets mixed reviews. His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk. Where he got good reviews lies in the government’s overall approach.”
Whalen noted that California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship.
Newsom told reporters: “We had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: ‘We’re gonna do the right thing’ and ‘You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise’. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.”
Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November’s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting.
It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush’s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Whalen said: “The question is how does he handle this as on a personal level. For Bush, the problem with Katrina wasn’t the federal response but Bush not getting out of the plane, not showing the personal touch. Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he’d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief.
“The economy is his trump card at all times. There are people who say: ‘I may not care for the tweets or his bombastic bluster but I’m making money while he’s in office.’ But now people will get their monthly statement and ask: ‘What happened to 10% of my portfolio?’”"

Coronavirus: Germany seals its borders as 100m Europeans on lockdown

First published on Sun 15 Mar 2020 12.25 GMT


Walls are being raised and mass quarantines enforced across Europe to combat the spread of the coronavirus, with Germany the latest to partly seal its borders, banning entrants from France, Switzerland and Austria from Monday.
More than 100 million people across the continent are on lockdown after Spain announced it would follow Italy in confining citizens to their homes for 15 days unless they had to buy food or medicine, go to work or seek medical treatment.
Spain’s death toll from the Covid-19 virus doubled on Sunday to 288 with more than 8,000 infections reported, the second-worst rates after Italy, where more than 1,400 people have died and more than 21,000 are sick. Italy announced a record one-day death toll of 368 on Sunday.
German media outlets said three of the country’s key borders would be closed amid more than 4,500 coronavirus cases and at least nine deaths, with exceptions made for cargo and commuters. Neighbouring countries Denmark, the Czech Republic and Poland have closed their borders to tourists.
Austria said gatherings of more than five people would be banned from Monday, part of a wave of restrictions across the continent the World Health Organization says has become the “epicentre” of the outbreak.
Non-essential shops would be closed along with restaurants, bars, playgrounds and sports venues, the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, announced, warning that the next weeks would be “challenging, difficult and painful”.
More than 800 people have been infected out of a population of 8.8 million and one person has died. Vienna has banned anyone entering from the UK, the Netherlands, Ukraine and Russia.
In France, where 91 people have died, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and most shops are shut. Plane, train and coach services between cities will be reduced from Sunday but Paris Métro services would continue for the time being, the government said.
Bulgaria said it would ban incoming flights from Spain and Italy.
With infections exponentially increasing in many countries, leaders of the G7 were preparing to hold an extraordinary summit via video link on Monday to try to coordinate a financial and medical response to the pandemic.
International travel and internal movement in many countries will be severely curtailed by restrictions set to come into effect over the coming days.
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.

In China, where the vast majority of fresh cases were being recorded among people arriving from abroad, rather than through domestic transmission, the government announced that anyone landing in Beijing from Monday would be quarantined for 14 days in a government facility.
Anyone arriving in Australia will be ordered to self-isolate for two weeks and could face steep fines for not doing so, the government said on Sunday, as two more people there were confirmed to have died from the virus. Nearly 250 people have tested positive, according to the country’s health department.
The US on Saturday added the UK and Ireland to a list of European countries from which entrants would be temporarily banned.
Pictures from several American airports showed huge crowds of people scrambling to return to the US, raising concerns that the government’s response might itself help to spark new cases.
The UK Foreign Office on Sunday advised against “all but essential travel” to the US. Donald Trump said on Saturday he had been tested for the virus and found negative.
The Philippines recorded four more coronavirus deaths and 29 new cases, bringing the domestic tally of infections to 140, with the entire population of the capital, Manila, placed under “community quarantine” for about a month beginning on Sunday.
The Vatican’s Easter services will be held next month without attendees, the Holy See has said, in a move believed to be unprecedented in modern times.
Iran, whose caseload and number of deaths are the highest in the world after China and Italy, announced 113 deaths over the past 24 hours, its highest single-day toll so far. More than 14,000 people have been infected and 724 have died, according to official statistics, the accuracy of which has been challenged by the WHO.
Those dying in the Iranian outbreak are significantly younger than elsewhere, with 15% of them younger than 40, according to health ministry statistics. The official leading the response was quoted on Sunday warning that the country’s sanctions-hit health system threatened to be overwhelmed by the virus.
The figures came as public authorities continued to disagree over measures to stem the flow of new cases. Some of the worst affected areas called for a quarantine of their cities, but the mayor of Tehran said the measure was not practicable. He has advised all people aged over 60 to stay home, but he is not imposing a closure of shops or offices. Officials are relying on citizens to show self-restraint.
A claim by the Revolutionary Guards on Friday that they were set to clean the streets, roads and shops over the weekend did not materialise, with large numbers of people still out in Tehran shopping and behaving as normal. The army instead started screening-drills in a small number of provinces.
The president, Hassan Rouhani, said he opposed curfews, and also rejected plans for fines to be imposed on anyone found to be driving while infected. He said it would be a sufficient punishment to turn people back, and gave the go-ahead for roadside checks in 11 provinces. He also announced a three-month grace period for hard-pressed businesses to pay tax, electricity, water and gas bills and banking loans.
Major sporting events in South Africa were cancelled as the number of cases there started to rise steeply to 51, almost all of them individuals who have recently returned from Europe or other hotspots.
Caseloads across Africa are still negligible compared with elsewhere but there were widespread fears that countries would have difficulty coping with large outbreaks, with only short supplies of ventilators and other critical equipment in many places."

There has been a huge difference in how the coronavirus pandemic has evolved in different countries. Some have gone nearly two months with just a few dozen cases; others have seen an outbreak explode in weeks.
The statistics about the early evolution of cases can be confusing, because some countries were slow to test or late to announce results. Italy’s first case was at the end of January, but the disease is thought to have been circulating there from the middle of the month. Likewise the steep rise of cases in Iran suggests it was spreading long before the first positive test.
Many of the countries that have had the greatest success in containing the disease are ones that were affected by Sars in 2002-03. The memory of that crisis may have led to better preparedness, in government and among the population, and to a greater willingness among people to comply with restrictions on movement and daily life to prevent the spread of infection.
There are three main aspects to controls that aim to stop the spread of the disease. The first is travel bans on people from areas with high levels of cases (initially mainland China, now many more places); the second is quarantine rules to prevent known or suspected carriers from spreading infection; and the third is shutdowns and social distancing to prevent transmission between unidentified carriers by reducing human contact.
Below we take a look at some of the worst-affected countries, and the most successful at containing coronavirus so far. China has not been included, because its circumstances are an outlier. But it is another example of how quarantine requirements, and strict controls on movement and social interaction, can dramatically curb the spread of the disease. On Friday it had only eight new cases, the first time that number has fallen into single digits since the outbreak began.
Initially, Italy did little to stop the spread of coronavirus. After it registered more deaths than any other country outside China, and the scale of the crisis became clear, it locked down first the northern region at the centre of the crisis and then the entire country.
Schools and universities have closed, along with all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies. Restaurants and bars are closed to customers, although they can make home deliveries. Sports events and outdoor gatherings are banned.
Permission is required if travel is vital for medical, work or personal reasons.
After announcing the first cases (and deaths) in late February, Iran did nothing about coronavirus – perhaps because the government felt it could not afford to offend China, a vital partner for the isolated country. Flights between Iran and China continued, and Iran donated a million face masks to China. Even after the toll began to rise rapidly, and senior politicians tested positive, health workers in small hospitals did not initially use protective gear.
Now schools have been closed and most Friday prayer services are cancelled. People have been urged to self-isolate, and the government has warned it may use force to prevent internal travel. The country has dug mass graves to bury the dead.
The country’s most important tool in fighting coronavirus has been its testing system; South Korea has run far more tests per capita than any other country – and nearly 10 times more than in the UK.
Many of those tested are members of the Shincheonji religious sect, whose members in Daegu city account for more than half of cases. There are 53 drive-through testing stations, allowing people to check their illness without physical contact.
Other measures include cancelling major events, and asking people to stay away from Daegu. The start of a new school term has been delayed from 2 March to the 22nd. Emergency childcare in classes of no more than 10 is offered for those who must go to work. Home working has been encouraged, with subsidies for companies that offer employees the flexibility to manage new care responsibilities.
GPS maps, available online to the public, track the movements of anyone confirmed to have the virus. South Korea also screens passengers leaving the country.
Widespread testing meant a jump in confirmed cases, currently more than 7,800, but resulted in a very low mortality rate, below 1%. New daily cases are down from a peak two weeks ago, and on Friday the country reported more recoveries than new cases, for the first time since the outbreak began.
Despite its closeness to China, physically and in economic terms, Taiwan has had extraordinary success in controlling the coronavirus. Efforts may have been helped by the Sars experience, and the fact that the vice-president is an epidemiologist.
Taiwan was probably the first country to try to stop coronavirus spreading, bringing in checks on travellers from Wuhan at the end of December, after reports of a mystery, pneumonia-like illness.
A command centre for epidemics kicked into action in late January, producing new policies and monitoring virus-tracking and treatment efforts. Wider travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were introduced despite the insistence of the World Health Organization (WHO) that they were not necessary. Extensive testing and contact-tracing through the public health system prevented the disease spreading.
School holidays were extended during late February, and schools can be closed again if cases emerge among students.
Travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were put in place, going beyond WHO advice. An exhaustive testing regime covered anyone with flu-like or pneumonia symptoms. All possible contacts of those infected were tracked, involving the police, flight manifests and a local test for antibodies that circulate after an infection clears.
Tests are free, and a huge public information campaign has urged even people with mild symptoms to see a doctor. The government covers medical bills for suspected or confirmed cases, so there are no financial risks to getting tested.
Self-employed people get a quarantine allowance, and employers are banned from deducting days in isolation from annual leave.
Measures can also be punitive, with one couple prosecuted for providing false travel history.
Most border crossings with mainland China have been closed, and people arriving from there must quarantine for 14 days.
Schools and universities closed in mid-January, and most remain shut, although a few private schools have partly reopened. Working from home has been encouraged where possible. Museums and sports facilities are shut, and people told to avoid large gatherings.
Those with strong memories of Sars have voluntarily stayed home when they can, and used masks and hand sanitiser when they have to go out.
The measures have also brought a drop in seasonal flu cases."

Coronavirus quarantine and self-isolation: your questions answered
","
Sarah Boseley Health Editor, and 
Martin Belam","What is the voluntary quarantine advice for people returning from areas affected by the new coronavirus if they start feeling unwell?


Tue 3 Mar 2020 09.40 GMT


First published on Thu 27 Feb 2020 17.56 GMT


Health authorities are advising that people returning from areas affected by the new coronavirus should self-isolate.
Self-isolation is a sort of voluntary quarantine, where people have to make their own arrangements.
They are expected to stay at home, and certainly not go to work or college. It has been described by public health officials as taking the same measures you would if you had a heavy cold – although perhaps the better comparison would be the flu.
The key thing is not to go near other people, to avoid spreading the virus, which is transmitted via droplets from coughs and sneezes. It is thought you need to be relatively close to inhale those droplets – maybe within a metre or so. But the droplets can also land on surfaces and transfer to people’s hands – hence the advice to wash them frequently.
At first, some officials suggested it would do no harm to go to the shops, assuming people keep their distance from others. But more recently they have been advising people to arrange food deliveries to their homes.
The virus is most likely to be transmitted at close quarters, to family members. Those people will be at risk in any circumstances if one of the family is infected.
If people are returning to family from an affected area, the others may want to keep their distance as much as they can – or self-isolate as well.
It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.
In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:
More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.
China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.
As of 9 March, more than 110,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have over 3,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. 62,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.
We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.
Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.

They should not go to a doctor’s surgery or medical facility, where they risk infecting other people, some of whom may be very vulnerable because they have health problems. They should stay home and call for advice. In the UK they should use the NHS 111 number.
These are voluntary measures and they cannot be compelled. Authorities have imposed stricter quarantine conditions on people known to have been exposed to high-risk situations."

The Covid-19 virus is a member of the coronavirus family that made the jump from animals to humans late last year. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel.
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.
Justin McCurry
The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two – the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.
Typical flu symptoms, which normally come on quickly, include a high fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, shivers, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, more occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea. Doctors are still working to understand the full scope of symptoms and severity for Covid-19, but early studies of patients taken to hospital found nearly all of them developed a fever and dry cough, and many had fatigue and muscle aches. Pneumonia (lung infection) is common in coronavirus patients, even outside the most severe cases, and this can lead to breathing difficulties. A runny nose and sore throat are far less common, reported by just 5% of patients. The only real confirmation of having Covid-19 is taking a test though.
If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.
A large study in China found that about 80% of confirmed cases had fairly mild symptoms (defined as no significant infection in the lungs). About 15% had severe symptoms that caused significant shortness of breath, low blood oxygen or other lung problems, and fewer than 5% of cases were critical, featuring respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ problems. However, it is possible that a larger number of very mild cases are going under the radar, and so this breakdown in severity could change over time as wider screening takes place. Older people and those with respiratory problems, heart disease or diabetes are at greater risk.
It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying about, but the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower. The World Health Organization’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, talked of 3.4%, but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases. We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted, which would bring the mortality rate significantly down.
Deaths are highest in the elderly, with very low rates among younger people, although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to a lot of virus are thought to be more at risk. But even among the over-80s, 90% will recover.
Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube – though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.
Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.
Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months “was not unreasonable to assume”."

Hong Kong: with coronavirus curbed, protests may return

Amid a global pandemic, Hong Kong’s famously crowded streets are eerily quiet. Most of the city’s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months.
Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution.
It’s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises.
In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people.
It’s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong’s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died.
After a rocky start, the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive – schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings.
There is tentative talk that containment efforts are working and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong’s authorities.
The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region’s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government’s classification of protesters as “rioters”.
Only one of the movement’s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns.
“I think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,” says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement.
“Question one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.”
Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong’s sociology department, says the protests “lost steam”, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with the traumatic university sieges and the success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections.
Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to “warrior style disobedience” – short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement.
A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets.
“To us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital. But when it comes to seeing our home being destroyed by tyranny in every way possible, values we have been upholding are twisted and devastated, the virus seems too minor an issue to hinder us from guarding our home,” she says.
“We will never back off. We are willing to do everything to fight against injustice and expose the truth even if our efforts seemed small and powerless.”
There is widespread acceptance that the fear of infection at mass gatherings has played a part in the diminished numbers.
However it has also driven its own protests.
The already low support and trust in the Hong Kong government and chief executive, Carrie Lam, were compounded by early missteps in responding to the virus.
“The wrong and inefficient allocation of resources [eg masks] and slow border closures incited hatred in our community too,” the administrator says, in reference to protests and strikes over Lam’s reluctance to close borders or place restrictions on travellers from mainland China.
“If the government had closed the border, we could have been able to stop the epidemic spreading in Hong Kong even more effectively.”
Kong says the policing of protests during the outbreak has been “more oppressive than ever”.
Alleged police brutality and mass arrests continue, including three high-profile pro-democracy figures on charges which observers said could apply to almost any protester, as well as hundreds of others at smaller events since.
Last Sunday, police were filmed pepper-spraying journalists and bystanders at a demonstration against the establishment of a Covid-19 clinic in a high-density residential area. Just hours later they were again accused of excessive force in trying to shut down a vigil for a young man who died when he fell from a car park during a protest in November.
On Wednesday the US State Department accused the Hong Kong government of an “apparent unwillingness to criticise the police force” or investigate alleged breaches of civil liberties. Hong Kong dismissed the report as foreign interference.
Albert Ho, a solicitor and high-profile pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, says it is clear there have been fewer confrontations and clashes since the virus, and authorities appear to be using the quiet time to round up key figures and organisers.
“I think they have come to a stage where they can say they have clamped down on these movements by the youngsters,” he says.
“So they have to do everything to deter the social organisers from continuing to organise marches and demonstrations on a big scale.”
Views differ within the movement on whether another organised, police-approved rally could draw people out in their millions again.
Junker says it looks like the movement is now trying to re-energise, but there’s “a lot of fatalism at this point, saying nothing is working”.
“The government has all the resources and institutional levers to follow up in these retributional ways.”
But it’s hard to predict.
“It’s like a weird kind of effervescent chemistry where [if] the right things converge and boom, you have two million people out on the street.”
Kong says: “One thing is certain – distrust and anger with the government has only grown, and people’s views haven’t changed: we’re sick of an unrepresentative and unresponsive government. We want democracy. How that manifests itself is hard to say.”"

'Sledgehammer on Trump, scalpel on Sanders': Biden approaches key debate

Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will square off in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night, in a contest moved from Arizona to Washington DC and held without a live audience due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The escalating public health crisis has played havoc with all areas of US life, but Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio will still go to the polls on Tuesday.
After his spectacular rebound on Super Tuesday and strong performances this week, Biden is ahead in delegates earned, seemingly on course for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November.
But Sanders has refused to throw in the towel, saying this week that though he may be “losing the debate over electability”, he is a champion for the views of most younger voters and wants to influence the general election platform.
“On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,” Sanders said, indicating he would challenge the former vice-president on healthcare reform, the minimum wage and other progressive priorities.
Nick Carter, Sanders’ political outreach director in 2016, told the New York Times the Vermont senator was “pivoting to ensure that the issues that he has built his political career around continue to be front and center in the political dialogue.
“I also think he has [at the] top of [his] mind ensuring his supporters and those unenthusiastic about a Biden candidacy don’t call it a day.”
Many in the Democratic establishment would prefer the independent from Vermont admit defeat and put his shoulder to the wheel for Biden.
In emails to the Guardian, Martin O’Malley, a former Baltimore mayor, Maryland governor and candidate for the presidential nomination, said he was “guessing, most kindly, that Bernie is thinking as quickly as Biden sprung back to political life, he could as easily stumble and so he has an obligation to hang in there.
“What he risks is that more and more people [see] his messiah veneer fall away and his hypocrisy on many issues – gun safety, immigration reform, Russia interference – will strip away his lovable old uncle persona.”
At the polls, Biden’s comeback from seemingly inevitable defeat has been powered by older voters, moderates, voters in swing counties and an overwhelming percentage of African Americans.
“I think Biden has been so battered and scarred already,” O’Malley said, “[that] I’m not sure there is much more that Bernie can do … in fact, Bernie could be a useful foil for Biden’s need to appeal to and win more independents.”
Reed Galen, a former aide to George W Bush and John McCain, left the Republican party in 2016 and is now part of the Lincoln Project, a super Pac devoted to producing ads against Trump.
Sanders is “using the core of his support base to not drop out gracefully”, Galen told the Guardian on Saturday, adding: “I don’t think Bernie Sanders has grace about him. From my perspective I think he should have [dropped out] and let the Biden campaign go and do the things it needs to do vis-a-vis Trump.
“But Bernie doesn’t care because he’s not a Democrat and never has been, so from his supporters’ perspective, if they wreck the Democratic party it’s just another win for them.”
Galen and O’Malley both expected a fiery contest in CNN’s Washington studio.
“Biden won’t stand there like a punching bag,” said O’Malley, who experienced the highs and lows of the debate stage alongside Sanders and Hillary Clinton. “He will hit back when pressed. And Bernie has no choice but to press.”
Galen said he thought Biden had a good opportunity to appeal again to moderates and independents, but added a warning about the pitfalls of any such bare-knuckle political bout, into which Biden has fallen in this and other elections.
“When you hit that debate stage it’s like a roller coaster heading downhill,” he said. “You hope it’s going to stay on the tracks but once in a while it goes flying off the edge.”
The coronavirus outbreak – which caused Univision host Jorge Ramos to step aside as a debate host after contact with someone exposed to Covid-19 – seems sure to dominate proceedings.
Both Biden and Sanders addressed the nation on the subject this week, attempting to present a contrast with Trump’s wildly uneven attempts to lead.
Galen said he thought Biden’s advisers would therefore seek to “utilise what Biden has been best at, which is relying on personal experience.
“We saw this week that he started talking about what he’s done in government and what government can and can’t do. I think his team will try to stay in that fairly narrow zone.
“But it wouldn’t surprise me if they also spend a fair amount of time focused on Trump. Here’s a way that he can use a sledgehammer on Trump but a scalpel on Sanders: by saying, ‘Here’s a guy we elected that had no experience, no people willing to work for him, no people he is willing to listen to. We can’t have that anymore.’”
Galen and O’Malley both deplored a tweet sent by Trump’s campaign this week which called Biden a “rotting corpse of a candidate”, and said it was a taste of the fierce and dirty fight to come.
“There is one question and only one question that viewers will be asking themselves during Sunday’s debate,” O’Malley said, “and it is this: which of these two candidates would do the best job of keeping me and my family safe in a big emergency, like, a pandemic.
“What I do know is that of the three men left [including Trump], more and more people are wishing Biden were already in charge.”
In fact, the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still campaigning. For the debate in Washington on Sunday, however, she did not meet qualification criteria set by the Democratic National Committee."

The UFC’s defiance of the coronavirus outbreak is reckless and irresponsible

In the wake of the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus 2019 a pandemic on Wednesday, major sports leagues in the United States and across the globe have reacted by canceling or postponing events. The NCAA canceled March Madness. MLB called off spring training and delayed the season, the PGA Tour canceled events, while the MLS, NHL and NBA have suspended their upcoming seasons until further notice. Yet despite the slew of professional organizations taking action to protect public health and safety, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, has no intention of deviating from its upcoming schedule and has instead decided to move some of its shows to Las Vegas.
As the coronavirus – officially known as Covid-19 – spreads across the United States, a growing number of states have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak, which allows states the authority to establish curfews, shut down public spaces, and a host of other restrictions. Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since announced that those shows (28 March 28 in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC’s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC’s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans.
The UFC also revealed that Saturday’s show in Brasilia, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city’s governor declared a ban on large gatherings. However, it appears that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission – the regulatory body responsible for fighter safety – was not intending on testing fighters for COVID-19, a troubling development given the contagious and unpredictable nature of the virus.
Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which is a virus related to Sars. The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control.
As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths.
Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks. These include practicing respiratory hygiene, social distancing and staying away from large-scale public gatherings. While sports organizations have interpreted this as an ethical obligation to suspend their seasons and cancel events, the UFC has no intention of canceling any upcoming shows.
“I talked to the president and the vice president about this, and they’re taking this very serious,” UFC president Dana White said during an appearance on ESPN’s SportsCenter on Thursday. “They’re saying, ‘Be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking.’ Everybody is panicking, and instead of panicking, we’re actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how to keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.”
White added that the UFC plans to screen incoming fans with “infrared technology” that would detect spikes in body temperatures such as those caused by fever. However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump’s response to the pandemic, which has been heavily criticized for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the longstanding friendship between Trump and White, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president’s blundered response to the outbreak.
It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows. Euro-African promotion ARES FC postponed an upcoming event in Belgium. ONE Championship followed suit and postponed its 20 March show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after hosting its previous event in Singapore behind closed doors. Combate Americas announced a “proactive plan” that included postponing upcoming shows and scheduling new ones on a closed-set TV studio, while Bellator postponed its Friday show hours before the event was set to begin.
Interestingly, White and the UFC have failed to address the status of UFC 249: Khabib v Ferguson, which is still scheduled to take place on April 18th at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. New York State governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York state last Saturday and has since placed a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city on Thursday and revealed that locations such as the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden could be closed for months to deal with what “could easily be a six-month crisis.” While the UFC will likely move its anticipated pay-per-piew event from Brooklyn to the Apex facility, it remains to be seen whether that will serve as a long-term solution for the promotion, especially given that Nevada has also declared a state of emergency.
White’s reaction to the outbreak over this past week, which includes the claim that he doesn’t “give a shit about the coronavirus”, suggests that the UFC will continue to push ahead with their planned events irrespective of concerns regarding public safety. During a time of crisis, the UFC’s stubborn insistence that the show must go on is not only a prime example of corporate greed but a betrayal of its responsibility towards its staff, its fighters and the public at large.
“This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a media briefing declaring Covid-19 a pandemic. “So every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.”"

Let’s start with what Malcolm Turnbull might call a penetrating glimpse of the obvious. The coronavirus pandemic looms as a global test.
This illness will test the efficacy of health systems and the competence of governments, their medical advisers, and major institutions. It will also test the civic responsibility of human populations.
This pandemic is a test for facts and evidence. The challenge of coronavirus has arrived in a post-truth age, and I suspect we are going to discover over the coming weeks and months whether experts and evidence still possess the gravitational force to anchor important conversations – or whether allegiance to tribe, coupled with the ceaseless noise of our hyper-connected societies, ultimately supplants truth.
McKay Coppins, who writes perceptively about American politics for the Atlantic, noted this week Donald Trump seemed determined, from the moment the virus reached the United States, “to construct an alternate reality around the outbreak”.
The Coppins piece was published before the Oval Office madness of Thursday, when Trump sent global markets tumbling when he seemed to blame the European Union for spreading a “foreign disease”, but that doesn’t matter, because Thursday’s behaviour is part of a continuum. The core of the Trump insurgency is weaponising mass distraction.
Coppins noted Trump has the instincts of an autocrat, but he uses different methods. Instead of silencing experts, or censoring the free media to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis, Trump “can simply use his presidential bullhorn to drown it out”. Unleashing a barrage of incoherence is intended “to bombard people with so many contradictory claims, conspiracy theories, what-abouts and distortions that they simply throw up their hands in confusion and exhaustion”.
Deconstructing Trump in this way is not a new insight. Steve Bannon, once chief strategist for Trump, called this core methodology “flooding the zone with shit”.
David Roberts at Vox has been arguing since 2017 that America is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, “a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know – what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening”. Roberts says American conservatives have triggered this rupture by rejecting the institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge, from scientists to journalists.
The new question Coppins posed was whether Trump’s methodology of sowing strategic doubt would continue to be a winner for him once his inveterate myth-making intersects with a rapidly escalating pandemic within his own borders.
During a pandemic, people get ill, people die, essential services get disrupted, and the economy wobbles. People suffer if their leaders are feckless or amoral. Perhaps more in hope than in certainty, Coppins wondered whether flooding the zone with shit, and being seen to do that, works when “the dangers are more tangible and immediate to voters, regardless of whether they support Trump”.
Implicit in this musing is a big question: will coronavirus trigger an inflection point when alternative reality, the currency of modern day demagogues, finally implodes in the face of lived reality, allowing the whole system to reset itself?
I reckon it’s the right question to ask, but I don’t know the answer, and to borrow from Lana Del Ray, hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have.
Let’s bail out of the insanity of the Trumpiverse and come home now. I said this week, after Scott Morrison unveiled his $17bn stimulus package, that evidence and expertise has staged something of a comeback. The battered technocrats, the maligned experts in Australia’s bureaucratic and political class, have hoisted themselves off the mat and appear to be exerting some influence.
Consider just one example. It is truly remarkable that in the space of a week, two at most, the Coalition executed a complete about-face on stimulus. You could easily miss it in the noise, but the Morrison government has now signed up to methods of pump-priming the economy that Liberals have spent more than a decade pillorying.
One senses Morrison’s hard-wired political pragmatism and the steady hand of Treasury in this gear shift (government people report the new secretary, Steven Kennedy, has been a source of rapid and reliable advice) but this must be beyond galling for Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan, who copped the decade-long blast for doing a version of what Morrison announced this week.
Lest I sound inexplicably upbeat this weekend, let me be clear. I haven’t fallen into a rapture about sanity suddenly resuming transmission in Canberra after a dispiriting interregnum.
We are a long way from that.
When it comes to the government’s management of the coronavirus, I have a bunch of practical questions. Is this stimulus large enough? Will it be rolled out quickly enough? Will people spend their handouts?
On the health side: was Morrison too slow on mass gatherings, and has this lack of urgency posed unacceptable public health risks? (Plenty of serious experts with medical training seem to think so, although the prime minister seems to be following the advice of his own highly reputable experts).
There was also one of those silly and counterproductive episodes that, in the age of rolling instant referendums, snowball, and become emblematic. There was the parable of the football match.
At the Council of Australian Governments meeting on Friday, Morrison pointed to the imminent necessity of cancelling large gatherings while saying in the same breath that he intended to go to an NRL game on Saturday night to watch his “beloved Sharkies” – plans he had to walk back once Peter Dutton revealed he had become infected with coronavirus.
It would have been better for Morrison to pull out on Friday afternoon to be consistent with where his own health advice was trending. But instead of ejecting elegantly, through a prism of considered leadership, there was an inelegant dismount late in the evening, and a mildly churlish statement from the office saying the prime minister had cancelled because of the “potential for the prime minister’s attendance to be misrepresented”. It wasn’t really clear by whom.
Related to this: I get that pandemics are fast moving, and complex to manage, but why is the messaging sometimes clear and sometimes confusing and seemingly contradictory, and could somebody perhaps fine tune that?
I suspect it might be better if the government started mapping out where things are likely to head to help prepare people for what’s just over the horizon, because as it stands now, some days it looks like advice is no sooner given than it is overtaken by new advice. Recent days have demonstrated messaging can be both clear and confounding, particularly in rapidly changing conditions. Also: where is the necessary public education campaign? That really does seem urgent.
So it should be clear that I am not saying the government delivered a stimulus package that wasn’t stupid, so everything is OK now. The only observation I’m making is the official coronavirus-related conversations in Australia are certainly contested, but they are occurring within the boundaries of expert advice, and what you might term shared reality. At least so far.
I really welcome that. We all should welcome that.
Unfortunately, a number of other conversations in daily political life under this government remain stubbornly outside that frame, and that general tendency undermines Morrison’s current efforts to project as a prime minister whose information can be trusted.
Climate change is the obvious one. Can anyone tell me why Morrison can be counselled by experts with scientific training in managing a pandemic – and be seen to be doing that – yet ignore equally valid expert advice about another existential risk? I’d really love to know.
The other obvious one is the sports grants fiasco. Morrison is point-blank refusing to engage with evidence that shows his office was a hands-on decision maker in at least one of the adjudications about sports grants, which runs counter to the narrative he’s constructed where Bridget McKenzie was the decision maker.
Morrison is also stepping around the central unresolved question about whether his government acted lawfully in allocating these grants. The prime minister steps around this inconvenience by either declining to take questions, or taking the questions and then declining to answer them.
Given this is all pretty depressing, let me leave you with one cheery thought.
The optimist in me says this week’s stimulus about-face example demonstrates that this government can turn on the head of a dime; that the opposite can also be true, if the time has come for the opposite to also be true.
Think of it this way. If the Coalition can spend a decade defaming Labor for the crime of stimulating the economy to ward off a recession, and then follow Labor’s playbook during a close encounter with an economic crisis on their own watch – then anything can happen.
Anything, truly. A serious shift on climate change. True confessions on sports grants. Both unlikely, but in high octane times such as these, it’s best never to leave your desk."

","What initially seemed localised is worldwide and economic pain will go on for longer than first thought
Travel bans. Sporting events cancelled. Mass gatherings prohibited. Stock markets in freefall. Deserted shopping malls. Get ready for the Covid-19 global recession.
Up until a month ago this seemed far-fetched. It was assumed that the coronavirus outbreak would be a localised problem for China and that any spillover effects to the rest of the world could be comfortably managed by a bit of policy easing by central banks.
When it became clear that Covid-19 was not confined to China and that the economic effects would be more widespread, forecasts started to be revised down. But central banks, finance ministries and independent economists took comfort from the fact that there would be a sharp but short hit to activity followed by a rapid return to business as usual.
This line of thinking has exact parallels with the events of 2007, when it was initially assumed that the subprime mortgage crisis was a minor and manageable problem affecting only the US – and nobody needs reminding how that ended.
If history is any guide, the global economy will eventually recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, but the idea that this is going to be a V-shaped recession in the first half of 2020 followed by a recovery in the second half of the year looks absurd after the tumultuous events of the past week.
What’s more, policymakers know as much. The Federal Reserve – the US central bank – does not need to be told by Donald Trump that it needs to cut interest rates and resume large-scale asset purchases known as quantitative easing. Wall Street is looking to the Fed to pull out all the stops when it meets on Wednesday and the world’s most powerful central bank cannot afford to disappoint.
In the coming weeks the Bank of England can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1%
In the UK the coordinated response by the Bank of England and the Treasury last week was seen as a textbook example of how policymakers ought to respond to the crisis. It was, though, only the start. Airline companies will quickly go bust unless they receive financial assistance. The same goes for retailers, many of them hanging on by their fingertips even before Covid-19. Britain has a new chancellor of the exchequer in Rishi Sunak and, from Monday, a new governor of the Bank of England in Andrew Bailey, and they will both be aware that the risks of doing too little too late are far greater than those of doing too much too soon.
So, in the coming weeks the Bank can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1% – the lowest they have ever been – and to resume its QE programme. Sunak will have to add to the £12bn he has set aside to deal with Covid-19.
As in 2008-09, the authorities in the eurozone have been slowest to act but there have been welcome signs in recent days – from Germany, most significantly – of the need for governments to spend, and spend big.
It has been clear from the start that Covid-19 affects both sides of the economy: supply and demand. The supply of goods and services is impaired because factories and offices are shut and output falls as a result. But demand also falls because consumers stay at home and stop spending, and businesses mothball investment.
Conventional policy measures – such as cutting the cost of borrowing or reducing taxes – tend to work better when there is a demand shock. There is a limit to what they can do in the event of a combined supply and demand shock.
Policymakers know that, which is why Sunak stressed in his budget speech that the economy faced a tough period. The aim is make the downturn as short and shallow as possible, even though the chances of this look vanishingly small.
One reason for that is because the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 is enormous. Entire countries – Italy and Spain – are in lockdown. The problems facing airline companies are symptomatic of a crisis facing the global travel industry, from cruise companies to hotels that cater for tourists. Discretionary spending by consumers appears to have collapsed in recent days.
Despite globalisation, much economic activity remains local but here, too, there will be an impact as people cancel appointments at the dentist, put off having their hair cut and wait to put their house on the market.
Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has estimated that output in Britain will shrink by 2.5% in the second quarter but says a 5% fall is possible. The more pessimistic estimate looks quite plausible.
What’s more, in a service-sector dominated economy much of the lost output is never going to be recovered. If people do not go out to their weekly meal at their favourite local restaurant for the next two months they are not going to eat out four times a week when the fear of infection has been lifted.
It also seems likely that the economic pain will go on for longer than originally estimated. Having imposed bans and restrictions, governments and private-sector bodies will be cautious about removing them. Countries such as Italy will be wary of opening their borders while there is a fear of reinfection. The idea that Premier League football will be back by early April is fanciful.
There is also a question of how long it will take consumer and business confidence to recover. Policy action by central banks and finance ministries can help in this respect but only so much. The chances are that the imminent recession will be U-shaped: a steep decline followed by a period of bumping along the bottom. There will be recovery but it will take time and only after much damage has been caused."

After the share market fell 7.4% on Monday, 3.5% on Wednesday, and more than 5% on Thursday you could be excused for thinking everything is buggered.
Do we need perspective? The market is around 23% below the peak of the past 12 months, which is much less a fall than in the October 1987 crash, and also the global financial crisis. In both cases the stock market lost about half of its value.
So that’s the good news.
The bad news is, oh boy, it can fall a lot more yet.
Yes, the long-term performance of the stock market is good – a 6.2% annual return over 35 years. But these hits take time to recover from.
It took around eight years to return to the pre-1987 crash peaks, and 11 years after the GFC.
That does not mean all our super is gone. This year will be carnage, but over the past 10 years the median annual rate of return for industry super funds has been 8% (for retail funds it is 6.3%).
The problem of course is what if those were the good times? Perspective is great only if normality returns.
The current national advice is to get tested if you:
The national coronavirus health information hotline is 1800 020 080.The federal health department has a coronavirus health alert website. 
The state health department websites and contact numbers are:
A 2006 Treasury department paper on “The macroeconomic effect of an influenza pandemic”, coincidentally co-authored by the current Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, concludes that “GDP could contract by over 5% over the first year following an outbreak of a highly contagious pandemic”.
But such a study did not consider that the world’s biggest economy is run by a megalomaniac with an aversion to reality. Consider that Trump gave a national TV address in which he stated at least three errors, all of which sent the US markets into their biggest fall for 33 years.
The lack of any international co-ordination is damning – no urgent meeting of the G20, not even a phone hook-up.
Trump has made the world more insular, at the very moment it needs to be the opposite.
And what about our government’s response?
It has been less than stellar.
The lack of a public information campaign is damning. Where are the health advice ads playing on TV? They haven’t been able to even get a cheap YouTube ad up to share on social media.
Should you get tested? How do you get tested? When should you stay home?
We should all know the advice by rote.
The economic stimulus, I think, also contains far too little on the health side.
During the GFC we needed to get people spending; now we first need to ensure it is safe for people to go out to spend.
An absolute priority must be to ensure people who are sick stay home. I would have considered providing casual workers with at least access to a 14-day government-paid sick leave equal to the minimum wage for coronavirus symptoms.
In such cases you need to go big to break through the noise. Nothing in the government’s announcement had you thinking “cripes, they aren’t holding back”. Mostly the reaction was instead was that more is needed.
The level of resources being put towards urgent and rapid testing should be jaw-dropping.
Instead, we had Morrison being grossly casual telling Alan Jones he is going to the footy and that “it’s important for our economy and just our general wellbeing ... that people sort of get on about their lives”.
At the same time the head of the AMA in Western Australia tweeted: “You want to go to the footy? I want my colleagues to stay alive. Cancel crowds at events. Close the schools soon.”
Later chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised that Coag recommended gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled (though not actually banned). Oddly that advice only comes into effect from Monday. I guess the virus gets the weekend off ...
Morrison’s TV address contained little health advice except “please visit health.gov.au or talk to your local GP” (because yes, GPs have so much time on their hands). He did not even address panic buying.
The $750 cash payment for government benefit cardholders also seems rather weak.
In 2008 the Rudd government’s first cash stimulus was $1,000 to $1,400 for pensioners and low-income households. It was followed up with $900 to households earning up to $80,000.
In 2008, $1,000 was worth 77% of average male weekly full-time earnings; $750 is just 40% of the current average of $1,840.
Crucially, the GFC payments did not have to account for people overspending while stocking up on supplies.
You would be smart to bet that the May budget will contain more than has been announced this week. I suspect we will need something even before then.

","Trump’s response has been inadequate but the system is rigged anyway. As always, the poor will be hit hardest
Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and just about the only official in the Trump administration trusted to tell the truth about the coronavirus, said last Thursday: “The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now … It is a failing, let’s admit it.”
While we’re at it, let’s admit something more basic. The system would be failing even under a halfway competent president. The dirty little secret, which will soon become apparent to all, is that there is no real public health system in the United States.
The ad hoc response fashioned late Friday by House Democrats and the White House may help a bit, although it’s skimpy, as I’ll explain.
As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it.
n America, the word 'public' means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good
Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job.
At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word “public” – as in public health, public education or public welfare – means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good.
Contrast this with America’s financial system. The Federal Reserve concerns itself with the health of financial markets as a whole. Late last week the Fed made $1.5tn available to banks, at the slightest hint of difficulties making trades. No one batted an eye.
When it comes to the health of the nation as a whole, money like this isn’t available. And there are no institutions analogous to the Fed with responsibility for overseeing and managing the public’s health – able to whip out a giant checkbook at a moment’s notice to prevent human, rather than financial, devastation.
Even if a test for the Covid-19 virus had been developed and approved in time, no institutions are in place to administer it to tens of millions of Americans free of charge. Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Healthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity. As a result, the nation’s supply of ventilators isn’t nearly large enough to care for projected numbers of critically ill coronavirus victims unable to breathe for themselves. Its 45,000 intensive care unit beds fall woefully short of the 2.9 million likely to be needed.
The Fed can close banks to quarantine financial crises but the US can’t close workplaces because the nation’s social insurance system depends on people going to work.
Almost 30% of American workers have no paid sick leave from their employers, including 70% of low-income workers earning less than $10.49 an hour. Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave. Friday’s deal between House Democrats and the White House won’t have much effect because it exempts large employers and offers waivers to smaller ones.
Most jobless Americans don’t qualify for unemployment insurance because they haven’t worked long enough in a steady job and the ad-hoc deal doesn’t alter this. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps and other public assistance is now linked to having or actively looking for work.
It’s hard to close public schools because most working parents cannot afford childcare. Many poor children rely on school lunches for their only square meal a day. In Los Angeles, about 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year.
There is no public health system in the US, in short, because the richest nation in the world has no capacity to protect the public as a whole, apart from national defense. Ad-hoc remedies such as House Democrats and the White House fashioned on Friday are better than nothing, but they don’t come close to filling this void.
Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

The Zoo of the New, edited by Nick Laird and Don Paterson. Such an anxious moment surely calls for the consolations of poetry. What you need is this fat anthology, in which Rosemary Tonks nestles up to Tennyson, and Sappho sits in close proximity to Seamus Heaney. Or what about The Prelude, Wordsworth’s epic autobiographical poem? Even if you can’t leave the house, its hundreds of pages will transport you swiftly and elegantly to the Lakeland fells – and, perhaps, to the happier times of your own childhood.
Middlemarch by George Eliot. Maybe you want a novel. This is a book so capacious and wise it cannot fail to suit a period of quarantine.
Chips: The Diaries of Sir Henry Channon. Not only are these journals, written by the snobbish, American-born Conservative MP for Southend, witty, gossipy and completely engrossing; they also cover the blitz and, as a result, come with a built-in sense of perspective. These bad times, like other bad times before them, will surely pass in the end.
My Dad Wrote a Porno. If you’ve never got round to listening to this, now’s the time. With loads of episodes, every one hilarious, ridiculous and with no relevance to real life, this podcast will cheer anyone up.
The Allusionist. This is about language, and never fails to engage: clever, witty, distracting.
In the Dark: Season 2. One for true-crimers. It’s about a Mississippi man who faced trial for the same murders six times: a shocking miscarriage of justice case, doggedly and brilliantly told. (Season 1 is also excellent, but it’s about child abduction and I found it quite distressing.) 
Detectorists (iPlayer/Amazon). Nothing happens. But this gentle tale of treasure-seekers, penned by Mackenzie Crook, who co-stars with Toby Jones (left), contains sublime depths and sharp humour amid the whimsy. Let Johnny Flynn’s achingly soft music wash over you as you watch the meadows, old stone and butterflies of England, and wonder when it’ll be safe to leave the house again to seek them.
Money Heist (Netflix). It sounds much better in the original Spanish (La Casa de Papel, or House of Paper) but it’s still the best subtitled/dubbed thing around. Combines a series of ingenious thefts with, for once, truly three-dimensional characters. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll fall in love. And series 4 lands in April.
Mendelssohn: Octet (1825). As exuberant and joyful as music gets; eight string players jostle for attention, chipping in like a witty dinner-table argument. Mendelssohn was only 16 when he wrote it.
Bach: Goldberg Variations (1741). Sharpen your brain with one of the greatest works of all time, Bach’s “aria” and 30 variations supposedly written to amuse an insomniac count. Fit to refresh the most jaded spirits.
Wagner: The Ring (1876). Wagner demands time, in the case of his epic four-part Ring cycle (Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Siegfried, Götterdämmerung), about 15 hours. All human life is there, and gods, valkyries and dragons, too.
An Elephant Sitting Still (2018) on BFI Player. In a time of global emergency, frivolity can feel inappropriate. That mood has me inclined towards something more sombre and reflective, like the late Chinese filmmaker Hu Bo’s searching, rageful four-hour drama.
The Matrix (1999) on Amazon Prime. Escaping into a virtual reality is also an option. Twenty years on, the Wachowski sisters’ cyberpunk dystopia feels a little dated but their vision of the future is fun to revisit."

The Australian arts industry operates on a knife-edge at the best of times – but in recent years, the pressure has reached boiling point: local creators have faced millions in funding cuts, with draconian laws decimating once thriving scenes.
Now, with the coronavirus pandemic causing the Australian government to recommend any gathering of more than 500 people be cancelled, the industry is bracing for the worst, with insiders describing “a growing sense of doom” about what’s to come – and politicians and industry bodies calling for an “urgent” plan to help.
Internationally, the threat of coronavirus has led to the cancellation of major tours and festivals including Coachella and Miami Ultra, and the stock of global tour promoter Live Nation plummeting $1.8m in a single day. But it was the nixing of SxSW that sent shockwaves through the Australian music industry.
Forty-three Australian artists had been selected from a pool of 7,000 to showcase at Austin, Texas: a rare opportunity to get in front of international managers, bookers and publishers, which can result in major global deals. Industry body Sounds Australia quickly pulled together a showcase livestream for 18 artists, but the cancellation was a substantial hit, and devastating for many.
And there have been big gig losses in Australia too: Miley Cyrus’s cancelled trip to Australia spelled the end for a major bushfire relief concert; Robbie Williams is no longer playing tonight in Melbourne; and My Chemical Romance’s decision not to tour saw major emo-punk festival Download cancel in Sydney and Melbourne, just seven days out from the event.
All this before the government’s announcement on public gatherings – and there is no way to predict how long it will last.
That was one bet that Mona founder and prolific gambler David Walsh didn’t want to take: he called off Hobart’s Dark Mofo festival on Wednesday, despite the fact that it was scheduled three months away, in June.
“A festival-wide last-minute cancellation would run into the millions, and likely end the event permanently,” said festival director Leigh Carmichael.
“I know [this] will murder an already massacred tourism, but I feel like I have no choice,” said Walsh.
Late on Friday, participants of Melbourne International Comedy Festival (MICF) were told the full festival was being cancelled. With more than 600 Australian and international acts, and more than 7,000 performances programmed, the three-week event was scheduled to begin on 25 March.
“We’re devastated by the news we have to share,” organisers told the participants, before announcing the cancellation. “Our primary concern is the health and welfare of our artists and participants, staff and audiences.”
The decision, while sad, was considered the right one by many artists involved: while some MICF events are run by the festival, who carry the risk, the majority are self-produced – and independent acts had been struggling to decide whether or not to go ahead.
“The way it’s structured makes it hard for small artists to make the call to cancel without anything official happening,” one told the Guardian, “but people [were] feeling awful about trying to promote in this environment – not just because of low turnout, but because it [felt] reckless.”
As of Friday, the festival had not confirmed whether it would be refunding registration costs, which run from $375-$685, or helping artists recoup other costs such as venue hire and staffing.
The news that MICF is cancelled is sad, also the right call, but mainly very confusing for my performance anxiety which, at the same time each year, prays MICF will be cancelled. (ps. Sorry! I didn’t mean it! I take it back! The Secret works oh no!)
Friday’s announcement recommending the cancellation of mass gatherings presents a major blow to Australia’s live performing arts industry, which contributes more than $2.5bn to the economy, according to industry bodies – but relies on getting people through the door.
Evelyn Richardson, the chief executive of industry body Live Performance Australia, issued a statement on Friday calling for the government to help.
“[With a forced] cancellation of live performance events, they need to … urgently develop a targeted relief package to keep businesses operating,” she said. “There are companies that will not have the balance sheet strength to withstand the combined impacts of box office failure and contract obligations, and some larger event cancellations may cause irreparable damage.”
The Australian Major Performing Arts Group echoed the sentiments in their own Friday statement, with shadow minister for the arts, Tony Burke, weighing in with his: “Australia’s arts sector was already fragile before the coronavirus crisis due to the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government’s cuts and neglect. Now with live performance ticket sales dropping and the list of cancelled events growing rapidly, the sector could be brought to the brink over coming months.”
When “no show means no income” in the performance industry, Burke said, “the government needs a plan for the arts sector and we need to hear what it is – urgently”.
At the time of publishing, neither Bluesfest (April), Vivid Sydney (May) or Splendour in the Grass (July) had announced cancellations – although if the government’s advice on mass gatherings remains in place, and is heeded, they will not be going ahead.
Doubt has been thrown on festivals with events that attract smaller crowds, too.
It’s the smaller companies and independent artists that are going to suffer the most
Announcing the program of Sydney writers’ festival on Thursday night, director Michaela McGuire added a caveat to the list of names: “There are inevitable lineup changes every year – but we are expecting more than most.”
By Friday, the festival had suspended ticket sales. “We are now carefully working through next steps and we’ll be in touch on Monday 16 March with a more detailed response,” CEO Chrissy Sharp said in a statement.
Theatre insiders are feeling anxious. Executive director of Theatre Network Australia, Nicole Beyer, told the Guardian, “If a project is cancelled, the independent artist’s wage is just completely gone. They’re on contract to contract. There’s no fallback. They can’t use leave.
“It’s the smaller companies and independent artists that are going to suffer the most,” she continued. “They don’t have reserves. They don’t have a way to get through bad times.”
Beyer supports the calls for federal stimulus. “We hope that the government will do the right thing by this industry.”
And the screen industry is facing its own risks. Production of Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic on the Gold Coast was halted this week after Tom Hanks was diagnosed with the virus; and according to reports, Marvel movie Shang-Chi – currently filming at Fox Studios in Sydney with a team of approximately 900 people – has suspended filming for two weeks, as director Destin Daniel Cretton awaits his test results.
Hollywood blockbusters operate in their own economy, but very few Australian arts bodies can take this kind of financial hit. In November it was said that many arts organisations – particularly smaller, independent groups – were already at “crisis point”. Then they spent the summer raising funds for the bushfire emergency. Now, it’s the pandemic. Do they have anything left to give?"

The Vivid Sydney light festival has been cancelled due to measures put in place to limit public gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus, as the number of diagnoses in Australia continues to rise.
However, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition – without crowds – into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. 
The number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New South Wales rose by 22 in 24 hours to 134, with more than 250 cases nationally. In Victoria, the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said eight new cases had been confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 57.
In Tasmania, passengers and crew were barred from disembarking from a cruise ship that docked in Hobart.
The NSW tourism minister, Stuart Ayres, said the decision to cancel Vivid was made after recommendations from the federal government to limit non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people.
Vivid, now in its 11th year, was scheduled to run from 22 May to 13 June.
“Vivid Sydney is a bright star of Sydney’s event calendar so the decision to cancel was not taken lightly. As the event owner, we must follow the advice of health officials to ensure the health and safety of our citizens and everyone involved with Vivid Sydney,” Ayres said.
“We have taken the decision early in consideration of those planning to travel to Sydney for the festival, our commercial partners, artists, and volunteers so as to minimise the disruption and impact on them.
“We are currently working through the full implications of the cancellation and will provide further information and advice as soon as it’s available.”
In 2019, a record 2.4 million attended Vivid, bringing $172m into the NSW economy.
Ayres said the decision to cancel was “another body blow” for the tourism industry, which has already endured challenges as a result of the bushfire crisis.
In NSW an additional 22 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 between 11am on Saturday and 11am on Sunday, NSW Health said in a statement.
The new cases include three people who recently returned from the United States, one who had returned from Singapore and another from the Philippines. Five people caught the infection after contact with other confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The source for the remainder of the 22 new cases is under investigation, however two of those had also travelled overseas recently, including one to the United States.
NSW Health said of the 134 cases, 60 were acquired overseas while 38 were infected after contact with a confirmed case. The remaining were either unknown or under investigation.
A further 1,924 cases in NSW were being investigated as possible Covid-19 cases while 20,511 people have been tested and cleared.
Meanwhile, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand’s NRL’s team the Warriors will stay in Australia after travel restrictions were announced by the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.
The second round will go ahead as scheduled without crowds.
“In the interim we will continue round two. At this stage we will play round two and assess the situation,” the Australian Rugby League commission chairman, Peter V’landys, said.
In Hobart, passengers and crews were told not to leave a cruise ship that docked in the city on Saturday. About 1,400 passengers and staff aboard the MSC Magnifica were told they could not return to the ship if they disembarked, an MSC Cruises spokeswoman told the Mercury.
No one on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers’ health. The ship left Italy in early January before the coronavirus became a global concern.
Tasmania’s acting director of public health, Scott McKeown, said on Saturday the state now had its sixth confirmed case of Covid-19 after a woman in her 60s tested positive.
She was identified as a close contact of a previous Tasmanian case, who had recently travelled overseas, McKeown said on Sunday.
The woman and all the other five cases in Tasmania were in a stable condition and remained in isolation receiving medical care.
The state’s Public Health Services had identified and contacted the woman’s close contacts. These people will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days and receive daily follow-up from PHS staff.
The new cases in Victoria this weekend include six men and two women with ages ranging from their teens to 60s.
One is a student – a known contact of case 17, a teacher from CareyGrammar. The student was not at school during their infectious period. Theschool will remain closed until the holidays. And as a precaution, 12classmates will home-isolate.
Sutton said all cases were recovering at home in isolation. All had acquired the infection from either overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19.
At present, there remained only one case in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission."

Melissa Davey","Exclusive: In letter to GPs Brendan Murphy says Covid-19 kits no longer available in some regions and there is ‘extreme pressure’ on protective equipment


Sat 14 Mar 2020 05.00 GMT


Last modified on Sat 14 Mar 2020 06.48 GMT


Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, has implored doctors for their help in a letter describing “extreme pressure” on personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing kits.
The letter, sent to all general practitioners on Friday said: “There is a particular issue I want to write to you about directly, to ask for your help.”
“Unfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,” Murphy wrote.
“Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing.”
As Australians rush to get tested, many people are being tested unnecessarily putting pressure on already stretched medical supplies. In the letter Murphy urges doctors to adhere to testing guidelines, and to make sure patients meet both the current epidemiological and clinical criteria for testing.
Only people who travelled internationally in the 14 days before illness onset or who had close or casual contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19, and also have a fever or acute respiratory infection need to be tested.
People with severe pneumonia with or without recent international travel are also classified as a suspect case requiring testing.
The head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone urged Australians to take some personal responsibility and to stop pushing doctors for Covid-19 testing unless they met the criteria or were severely unwell.
We are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can’t just be testing to relieve anxiety.
“It’s clear that there is a significant amount of people who are being tested at the moment for no other reason than just fear, anxiety or personal interest,” Bartone told Guardian Australia.
“The criteria that have been clearly outlined in the letter are in the interest of ensuring adequate supply at this crucial time while we’re facing a significant pressure on reagents and kits.
“We are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can’t just be testing to relieve anxiety. We can’t just be relieving anxiety in a population with no contact with a confirmed case.”
Bartone said the rush to hospitals and doctor clinics for testing was an extension of panic buying being seen in supermarkets. He urged people to think of vulnerable people including the elderly before asking for tests.
“This is a self-limiting condition. For a small minority it will have significant consequences and unfortunately many Australians will lose their lives. We need to make sure resources are allocated appropriately to minimise risk to communities as a whole. The more irresponsible we are the more likely we are to see an earlier onset and peak.”
On Saturday Murphy said during a press conference there had “been quite a run on the testing and we had some temporary shortages in testing materials”.
“I do want to emphasise that we are still saying, because community transmission is so low at the moment, that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are symptomatic,” he said. “We don’t want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to go and get tested. We need to preserve the testing for those who need it.”
The federal health department has published an updated fact sheet for the public about the virus.
President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, said countries where the tests originated from, including Italy, “are keeping their tests”.
“All the countries are in short supply for their own populations,” he said. “So yes, we are going to run into problems if we have low-threshold testing.”"

Paul Karp","Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says school closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food are ‘premature’ at the moment


Sun 15 Mar 2020 02.51 GMT


First published on Sun 15 Mar 2020 01.13 GMT


School closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food to prepare for coronavirus self-isolation are “premature” for the general population, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, have said, though all options are on the table.
Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin “practising” to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly.
Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required.
Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight’s worth of food.
Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled.
Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports “or things of that nature”.
On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government’s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a “six-month window” although it “might be longer”.
Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” he said. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
“There are no options that are off the table,” Hunt said. “The paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.”
Murphy said authorities were “strongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call ‘social distancing’.
“So that’s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact … not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.”
Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more “may well change” but Australia, which he said had “only 250 cases”, was still “ahead of the curve”.
“If you’re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should … [exercise] more social distancing,” he said, and “avoid things that aren’t essential”.
Murphy said for others the risk of attending public places with fewer than 500 people, such as a cinema, was still at this stage “relatively low” and at the moment authorities were not recommending people stop taking the train. As case numbers increase, the medical advice will respond to recommend greater social distancing, he said.
“I think the gym is fine but everybody at the moment needs to practise very good hygiene.
“If you’re going to the gym, I would be very focused on hand washing, using hand sanitisers, all of those social distancing, good hygiene measures, we want everybody in the community to start practising those.”
Asked about the Victorian chief medical officer’s suggestion people should stockpile a fortnight’s worth of food, Murphy replied it was “a little bit premature at the moment”.
“For most people we don’t want to encourage major panic buying at the moment – we’ve seen that with the supermarket chains. But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.”
Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice.
He said governments did not want to “move too early” because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and “taking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains”.
Murphy said there was “no question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they’ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time”. “So you don’t want to move too early.”
Murphy said there were “very few reports of symptomatic infection in children” and authorities don’t know “whether children are getting infected but just don’t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they’re not getting infected”. “The former is probably more likely.”
Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity.
Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they’re feeling unwell.
Murphy said Australian authorities define “close contact” – which requires self-isolation – as “someone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before”.
He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are “very, very unlikely to have been infectious”.
On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was “aghast” at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response.
Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy’s advice on hand shaking was “inconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying” and argued there is “no coherent advice” about whether schools should open from Monday.
Bowtell said the government appeared to “have no plan” for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was “imperative” to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals.
Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday.
Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an “abundance of caution” and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined.
Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined “the relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March”, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday’s meeting.
On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a “national cabinet” made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday.
So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn.
The Morrison government has set up a new coronavirus business unit in the Treasury to support business confidence, employment and business continuity."

Major Australian theme parks including Movie World, Sea World and Wet’n’Wild say they intend to remain open, despite the government saying gatherings of more than 500 people should not occur in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Following a meeting with state premiers on Friday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced mass gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The announcement has thrown sporting codes into chaos, spun the arts industry into disarray and led to the cancellation of major events such as the Royal Easter Show and the Melbourne Grand Prix.
But despite that, Australia’s famous cluster of theme parks on the Gold Coast say they intend to keep operating.
In a statement on Saturday, Village Roadshow, the owner of major parks Movie World, Sea World and Wet’n’Wild, said that after discussions with the Queensland government it believed “the nature of our business does not apply to this advisory”.
The company said it would put in place “additional stringent hygiene and safety measures” including “an increased number of hygiene hand-washing stations,” “updated signage” about hand-washing techniques and on-site nurses to address the spread of the virus, but would not close.
“At Village Roadshow Theme Parks, the safety and wellbeing of our guests and team members is our utmost priority,” the company said in a statement.
“The Council of Australian Government’s advice today regarding public gatherings was directed at static-seated events of more than 500 people for a duration of over two hours.
“Based on our discussions with the state government, the nature of our business does not apply to this advisory.”
That’s despite other major theme parks including Disneyland and Universal Studios in the US announcing their closure.
Disney announced on Friday that it would shut down its California theme parks until the end of March over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, while Florida’s Disney World would close to guests from Sunday.
Comcast’s Universal Studios theme park in southern California also said it would close from Saturday and expected to reopen 28 March.
The Queensland Electoral Commission will also insist that voters go to the polls for local government elections in the state on 28 March.
“The forthcoming Queensland elections are essential public events required to ensure the continuity of democratic representation and public administration across the state,” the Queensland electoral commissioner, Pat Vidgen, said.
“It is extremely unlikely that more than 500 people would ever be in a polling booth at any one time, and electors generally only spend a short period of time in a booth.
“The ECQ will continue to monitor advice being issued by health authorities to ensure that the elections are conducted with minimal risk to the health and safety of Queenslanders.”
Home affairs minister Peter Dutton, a Queensland resident, has taken the state’s coronavirus figure to 35. Queensland also began recording its first cases outside the south-east on Friday, including cases in the towns of Rockhampton and Kingaroy."

Supermarket giants have put limits on purchases of food staples to prevent panic buying sparked by the coronavirus.
Coles and Woolworths have introduced a limit on some goods to ensure there is enough for everyone, especially the elderly, by preventing people stockpiling.
Coles customers will be limited to two packets of pasta, flour, rice, paper towels, paper tissues and hand sanitiser per transaction, it confirmed on Friday.
Coles Group chief executive officer Steve Cain said there are “some additional limits on certain items in each store” and has temporarily suspended change-of-mind refunds.
“From today we will be temporarily suspending our change-of-mind refund policy to discourage over-purchasing,” he said in the statement.
“If you have already purchased additional items you no longer want, please look at donating them to community organisations or neighbours who have been struggling to purchase them during this time.”
Earlier in the week, Coles reduced their toilet roll limit from four packs to one per transaction, after shoppers stripped shelves amid fears of the spread of Covid-19.
Woolworths has dropped its toilet paper limit to one pack per customer transaction and restricted purchases of other basics.
Shoppers at Woolworths can buy two packs of tissues and hand sanitiser, and one pack of rice, paper towels, serviettes and wipes per shop.
The company will also no longer accept change-of-mind refunds and exchanges on some products in higher demand than usual, including toilet paper, tissues, rice and pasta.
Both companies are working to bring in more stock to keep up with panic-buying demand."

Ben Butler","Two big Australian banks abandoned plans to raise money from investors this week and observers say that’s just the start


Sat 14 Mar 2020 00.06 GMT


Last modified on Sat 14 Mar 2020 00.12 GMT


The devastation wrought on the Australian stockmarket by the coronavirus pandemic has made it impossible for companies to raise fresh money, with two bank funding injections totalling at least $2.5bn called off.
Billions of dollars in other attempts to raise money have also been cancelled as investors close their wallets after two wild weeks of trading erased more than a year’s worth of gains.
“Effectively, the window to raise capital is closed,” said fund manager Geoff Wilson of Wilson Asset Management, who himself this week canned a plan for one of his funds to buy between $10m and $20m worth of shares back from investors.
Asked if he thought it would open again any time soon, he said: “No.
“It would only be the desperate who would be raising [money] at the moment,” another market observer said.
On Thursday evening, after the biggest one-day fall on the Australian market since 1987, NAB abandoned plans to raise about $2bn by selling investors notes – financial instruments that pay a steady flow of coupons.
It’s believed the decision was taken following what sources said were “robust” discussions by the NAB board.
Smaller rival Macquarie followed suit on Friday morning, as the market was again plunging, yanking a $500m note issue of its own.
The notes, known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt, carry greater risk than either because they are the first to take losses when things go wrong.
But they are extremely popular with Australian mum-and-dad investors who have confidence in the strength of the country’s banking sector because they provide relatively high returns.
The prices of both were set last month, before the virus smashed the market. But after the falls in the share prices of the banks – on Friday night, NAB’s share price was down by a third since 20 February and Macquarie’s down almost a quarter over the same period – those prices became wildly unrealistic.
Sources said that if the NAB and Macquarie notes had been issued at pre-crash values then their prices would have immediately crashed once they began to trade, making investors angry and leaving the banks looking like they were under financial pressure.
“If they’d proceeded with it they would have been slaughtered when they came on,” one market source said of the NAB notes. “Obviously it’s bad for the investors but it’s also really bad for NAB.
“Which bank wants to issue capital at a massive discount?”
Sources say figuring out new prices for the notes was too hard because the markets were too volatile – a point proven on Friday when, after dropping 8% in early trade, the benchmark ASX 200 rallied to finish the day up more than 4%.
Also on Friday, Pengana Private Equity Fund abandoned a $470m capital raising, telling the market that “current market volatility makes it impossible to conduct an orderly process”.
The previous day, corporate lender Metrics Credit Partners handed more than $340m back to investors after falling well short on its hopes to raise up to $640m and list a fund on the ASX.
Wilson said the market as a whole was in a “fear phase”.
“This is the steepest fall we’ve ever seen in the market,” he said.
He said it combined the speed of the falls experienced in the crash of 1987 with the relentlessness of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when markets around the world fell day after day after day.
“This is the steepest fall we’ve ever seen in the market,” he said.
“From the start of the bear market [in 1987] to the bottom, that was about 50% and it took seven weeks.
“This has been faster.
“We’re a month in and we’re down something like 30%.”"

Coronavirus contact: Ivanka Trump works from home after meeting Peter Dutton

Ivanka Trump worked from home on Friday but will not self-quarantine, despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who on Friday confirmed he had tested positive for coronavirus.
Dutton released a statement late on Friday confirming that he had gone into self-isolation after testing positive for the virus.
The home affairs minister had recently returned from a trip to the US where he held meetings with senior Trump administration officials including Ivanka Trump, the US attorney-general, William Barr, and officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.
In a statement, the White House said it was aware Dutton had contracted the virus, but that senior officials would not need to quarantine because the minister was “asymptomatic during the interaction”.

Instead the president’s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka, who was photographed next to Dutton during the trip, worked from home on Friday “out of an abundance of caution and until guidance was given”.
“The White House is aware that Mr Dutton tested positive for Covid-19,” the White House said.
“He was asymptomatic during the interaction. Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine.
“She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.”
A spokesman for the attorney general William Barr also said the Attorney General would work from home on Friday but was not showing coronavirus symptoms.
“He is staying home today and has consulted with CDC,” Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.
“CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point.”
Other officials including a senior counsellor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, said she had been advised she did not need to quarantine.
“White House Medical Unit (WHMU) informed me earlier that Mr Dutton was asymptomatic during the interaction,” Conway wrote on Twitter.

“Exposures from the case were assessed and the WHMU confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that I exhibited no symptoms & need not self-quarantine.”
But New Zealand cabinet minister Tracey Martin, who met with Dutton during a Five-Eyes partners meeting in Washington DC, has reportedly gone into self-isolation following his diagnosis.
A spokesperson for Martin told Radio New Zealand that while the minister and New Zealand First had shown no symptoms, she had been tested for the virus and was self-isolating until test results were returned.
Martin reportedly did not shake Dutton’s hand when she was overseas.
On Tuesday Dutton attended a meeting with Australian cabinet members including the prime minister, Scott Morrison. He was also was part of a discussion of the national security committee of cabinet on Thursday via a video link.
However Morrison said late on Friday that he did not intend to be tested and that no one in the cabinet would be required to self-isolate. The prime minister did cancel plans to attend a football match in Sydney on Saturday.
Speaking to radio station 2GB on Saturday, Dutton, said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning.
But he said that he’d spoken to Queensland Health authorities on Friday night who had begun contact tracing back to Wednesday morning and were not concerned about his earlier contacts.
His wife and children had not displayed symptoms but were self-isolating.
“Their advice to me is they’re concerned with people that I’ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th. So beyond that, it’s not further back, there’s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there’s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That’s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.”
Dutton is not the first person to be diagnosed with the coronavirus to have recently come into contact with senior members of the US government.
On Friday the White House said the president, Donald Trump, had no plans to be tested for coronavirus or go into self-quarantine after attending events last weekend with a senior Brazilian official who tested positive for the illness.
Fabio Wajngarten, a communications secretary to Jair Bolsonaro, met with Trump during a visit by the Brazilian president to Florida.
On Thursday the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said both Trump and the vice-president Mike Pence, who was also at the meeting, had “almost no interactions” with Wajngarten and therefore did not need to be tested themselves.
But during the visit Wajngarten shared on Instagram a picture of himself, Trump, Pence and Brazilian TV presenter Alvaro Garnero, while in one video, Wajngarten (wearing glasses) was seen just behind Bolsonaro and Trump."

Michael McGowan","Chief medical officer warns people being tested unnecessarily and that virus may not peak until ‘well into the middle of the year’

The Australian government has announced a national publicity blitz aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 as the country’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the infection rate of the virus may not peak until “well into the middle of the year”.
As Australians brace for the shutdown of major sporting codes, concerts and festivals in a dramatic scaling-back of day-to-day life not seen since the Second World War, the federal government has announced the release of a national advertising campaign to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. Australia now has 200 cases of the virus, as New South Wales reported 20 new cases on Saturday, its biggest daily increase since the pandemic began.
The education campaign comes after criticism of the government’s response to the crisis and an acknowledgement by the chief medical officer that the country’s supply of crucial medical equipment including personal protective gear and pathology test kits was “deteriorating rapidly”.
From Sunday, the government will release two separate television advertisements which encourage stringent personal hygiene and warn people who have recently been overseas or in contact with someone who has the virus to “seek medical advice” and self-isolate if they develop symptoms.
The campaign, which will also include outdoor advertising on buses, at train stations and in shopping centres, includes the slogan “together we can help stop the spread and stay healthy”.
It also advises people to only be tested for the virus “if you are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms and have recently returned overseas or have been indirect contact with someone who is known to have contracted coronavirus”.
Earlier on Saturday the country’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the spread of the virus may not peak until “well into the middle of the year”.
“If we get a large outbreak [it] could go well into the middle of the year before it peaks,” he said.
“But there are some countries ... which seems to have peaked quite early and controlled the outbreak. One of the things we know about outbreaks and epidemics as they are very hard to predict.
“But it depends how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day.”
If the virus were to continue to spread more rapidly into the winter, it could place significant strain on Australia’s medical resources. As the Guardian has reported, a letter sent by Murphy to GPs on Friday warned the country’s supply of personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing kits was already under “extreme pressure” with supplies “deteriorating rapidly”.
“Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing,” Murphy wrote.
Also on Saturday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, spoke publicly for the first time since he was diagnosed with the virus. Speaking to a Sydney radio station from his sickbed at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Dutton said he was feeling “much better” and insisted health officials were not concerned about his contact with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, or Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president.
“Fever has gone this morning, temperature is down, my throat was very mild to start with so probably still a bit sore but very mild in that sense,” he said.
Dutton, who said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning, attended a cabinet meeting with senior government ministers including the prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and before that was in the US where he met with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president.
Both Trump and Barr worked from home on Friday in the US after Dutton’s diagnosis was confirmed, but the home affairs minister said that he’d spoken to Queensland health authorities who were not concerned about his earlier contacts.
“Their advice to me is they’re concerned with people that I’ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th,” Dutton said.
“So beyond that, it’s not further back, there’s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there’s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That’s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.”
In New Zealand, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that anyone entering the country, except for people from Pacific Islander countries, would need to self-isolate for two weeks.
That announcement, which comes despite the country recording only six cases of the virus so far, has potentially widespread consequences for the Super Rugby and NRL competitions already beleaguered by the Australian government’s decision to advise against all mass gatherings of more than 500 people.
“This decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,” Ardern said on Saturday.
In further developments courts across the state of Victoria in Australia will immediately suspend all future jury trials in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. The drastic measure will apply to the county and supreme courts.
Supreme court chief justice Anne Ferguson said all new jury trials would be suspended but that trials in which a jury had already been empanelled would continue.
“This means that the jury empanelment process, in which hundreds of potential jurors gather at court, will not take place until further notice,” Ferguson said.
The Northern Territory local court announced on Saturday evening it too would suspend all circuit court services effective immediately.

Urgent efforts to repatriate 30,000 British tourists from ski resorts in France are under way amid warnings of “widespread failures” in the travel sector in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
French mountain resorts closed at midnight on Saturday, hours after tens of thousands of skiers had landed for their annual holiday in the snow.
Leading ski and summer activity holiday company Neilson has called for the government to step in with “emergency measures”.
There were reports of chaos and confusion across the Alps with one source saying local police had taken the French government’s message into their own hands and were going round hotels and restaurants telling marooned Britons to go home immediately.
Diane Palumbo, sales and marketing director at SkiWorld, said she had 900 customers across the Alps and they had been in talks with all the key resorts on Friday to warn them that if they were to close, not to do so on Saturday when a fresh influx of tourists were scheduled to arrive.
“We are getting over our anger. It was literally not until 10pm last night that we were confident of the information we were receiving. The same people who had assured us on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday that they would remain open, have now all closed,” she said.
The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, announced at 8pm that the country must close all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops from midnight.
Although ski resorts were not specifically listed, the ski industry in the UK believe they are all closing.
One of the biggest operators, Inghams, said “as a responsible tour operator” it would not be operating any more holidays to French resorts for the rest of the season and advised those who were due to go out on Sunday to abandon their plans.
“Even though the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice has not changed, as a responsible tour operator, we will not be operating Inghams ski holidays to these resorts for the rest of the 2019/2020 winter season: Alpe d’Huez, Avoriaz, Chamonix & Les Houches, Courchevel, Flaine, La Clusaz, La Plagne, Les Arcs, Les Menuires, Les 2 Alpes, Méribel, Montgenevre, Morzine, Samoens, Serre Chevalier, Tignes, Val d’Isère and Val Thorens,” it said in a statement on its website.
Palumbo said all those who had booked through an Atol-backed agent would get their money back but that small- to medium-sized tour operators and travel companies could go bust.
“The airlines are very quick to ask for help from the government but this is a massive flow of people which will costs the industry millions. If the government does not step in travel companies will start to fail because the cost of repatriation will be enormous,” she said.
She explained that travel companies pay bonds to cover emergencies but if travel companies go to the wall the money will have to come out of government coffers. If they are going to bail out travellers at the end of this, would it not be better to step in earlier in the crisis and in doing so save businesses and jobs as well as holidaymakers, she argued.
David Taylor, the chief executive of Neilson holidays, said it was “hugely disappointed” that it received “such short notice” on the closures.
He called for “emergency measures” for the sector.
“With the Covid-19 crisis likely to last several months, we are asking the government to consider emergency measures specifically targeted at the travel and leisure sector to deliver immediate relief and help avoid widespread failures.
“This remains an isolated issue on 2020 departures only and we are confident that next year will see a healthy recovery provided a swathe of relief measures recommended to the government are enacted,” he said.

Separately Ryanair was frantically working to repatriate customers stranded in Spain after the country was thrown into lockdown. It has also cancelled all flights to and from Poland.
“Ryanair Group Airlines (including Buzz and Lauda) has been forced to severely reduce flights to/from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from 24.00 Sun 15 Mar until 24.00 Thurs 19 Mar,” it said in a statement.
It added it was “contacting all affected customers by email to advise them of their options and we urge customs not to call us”.
The British ambassador in Spain issued a message on Sunday to Britons visiting or living in Spain. In a video shared on Twitter, Hugh Elliott said it was “important to be clear the Spanish government has not restricted international flights. We expect you to be able to return home as planned.”

Florida: coronavirus fears could hurt voter turnout in crucial primary

Governor Ron DeSantis last week declared a state of emergency in Florida in the face of the coronavirus as millions of Floridians are set to vote on Tuesday in a crucial delegate-rich primary that will help determine whether Bernie Sanders stays in the Democratic presidential nomination race against Joe Biden.
In Florida, the impact of the virus, if left unchecked, could be particularly harsh on the state’s ability to allow people to vote or vote safely without fear of infection.
The state is home to one of the largest elderly populations in the country, with around 20% of the residents age 65 or older. While this age group tends to be a stable voting bloc for both political parties, it’s also the most vulnerable to the virus – which has a mortality rate around 18% for those over 80 years old.
DeSantis issued an executive order barring people who may have been exposed to the virus from visiting nursing homes. He urged election officials throughout the state to consider moving their polling locations for the state’s 17 March primary out of those locations.
But over the weekend before election day, the state seemed to be lacking a unified response, with many polling stations in senior centers and retirement communities still operating at status quo.
Workers at Country Aire Manor, Senate Manor Estates, and Crystal Lakes Manor – Pasco and Pinellas county polling sites all held in communities comprised entirely of people above 55 – said they had received no guidelines for the election, and were already receiving equipment to set up for Tuesday.
“All locations will be open,” said Robin Lehoux, who works at the parks and recreation department in Pompano Beach, Florida. She hadn’t heard of any instructions from the state or local government regarding the Mullins Park Senior Center, a polling precinct where other senior programming had been shut down.
But Florida’s piecemeal response has been a stark departure from other election officials across the country implementing last-minute measures to stave off concerns about contracting coronavirus at the polls. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered all polling stations in senior centers and nursing homes to be relocated. Louisiana’s state’s top election official, Kyle Ardoin, announced Friday the primary election next month would be postponed until June.
“They’re playing catch up,” said congressman Darren Soto, who represents a central Florida district that includes Orlando. Soto was still expecting a large voter turnout on Friday, and said he was focused on making sure voting precincts remained open so crowds were dispersed. “The main thing is to avoid long lines so people can conduct best practices.”
Some election officials are still taking full precautions.
In Broward county, the local supervisor of elections announced this week the county was moving 12 precincts from senior centers and assisted living facilities to alternate locations. The county sent out postcards to all of the voters who would normally cast ballots there letting them know their locations had moved.
Some senior living facilities don’t want to move their polling locations because they are wary of having to transport residents, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for the Broward county elections office. In such cases, the county elections office will make sure they have adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies, Vancore said.
﻿
State officials held a conference call with local supervisors of elections on Thursday to discuss sanitary measures they could take at the polls. In Volusia county, the supervisor of elections reminded voters they could bring their own pens to fill out ballots. In Marion county, elections officials have limited cleaning supplies and are encouraging people to bring their own from home, said Wesley Wilcox, the county’s supervisor of elections.
Florida is no stranger to adapting elections to emergencies.
In 2018, Hurricane Michael derailed precincts in the panhandle, and forced election officials to extend voting hours and move locations. In 2016, a federal judge extended voter registration because of disruptions caused by Hurricane Matthew, despite opposition from Republican governor Rick Scott.
But the state often only acts at the last minute. “It’s a fight every time,” said Brad Ashwell, the Florida director of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. The organization was looking to support changes for the primary that could include an extension in vote-by-mail deadlines, poll worker recruitment, as elderly poll workers dropped out, and more state funds to advertise changes to the polling stations.
“It seems like the freak out level is slowly creeping in here,” Ashwell said. “I don’t sense anxiety among people. People are upset their conferences are being cancelled. But it doesn’t seem like there’s a real high levels of concern.”
Meanwhile, he said, the fears around Covid-19 could build on other issues that voters faced in the state. Under the pressure of lawsuit brought on by civil rights groups and Puerto Rican residents, the state has been attempting to provide bilingual language assistance at each station, which could be impacted if poll workers don’t show up on Tuesday.
And the state rejected tens of thousands of mail-in ballots and absentee ballots in recent elections, stoking mistrust in that system.
Danny Turkel, spokesperson for Voto Latino, an advocacy group focused on registering Latinx voters, said he predicted lower voter turnout in the election because of the state of emergency. He didn’t think any specific community would be impacted, he said, but predicted that the uncertainty would keep voters at home.
“Being from Miami, I’m acutely aware of the difficulties people have,” he said. “There were already obstacles in the way that the state has done nothing to improve.”
“I think it will show out in the numbers.”"

Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus as he announced new measures to tackle the crisis, including expanding the existing US travel ban to cover the UK and Ireland.
In a lunchtime briefing at the White House on Saturday, the president confirmed he had taken a test for the virus after coming into contact with a Brazilian government official last week in Florida who later tested positive for the disease.
The president’s physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement on Saturday evening that Trump’s test was negative. 
“One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago [in Florida], the president remains symptom-free,” Conley said in his memo. “I have been in daily contact with the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.”
Dr Conley had said on Friday that there was no need to quarantine the president or implement a test because the encounter with Bolsonaro aide Fabio Wajngarten was “low risk”.
But on Saturday it was reported that Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who was also at Mar-a-Lago, had been tested after displaying relevant symptoms.
On Saturday, Trump told the media he had taken a test on Friday night after all, announcing it at a press conference to which reporters were admitted only after having their temperatures taken, and from which one unidentified journalist was turned away.
Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump entered self-isolation on Friday after meeting an Australian politician later revealed to have tested positive. News of Trump’s test followed days of controversy highlighted by his continuing to shake hands with people, even as official advice recommended “social distancing”.
“It becomes a habit. People walk up to me, they shake hands, it’s kind of a natural reflex,” Trump said. “Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I tend to agree.”
He also indicated the extension of the travel ban, already in place for 26 European nations. The vice-president, Mike Pence, duly announced that travelers from the UK and Ireland would be subject to the ban from midnight US eastern time on Monday.
The president also raised the prospect of some kind of domestic travel restrictions, and advised the public: “If you don’t have to travel I wouldn’t do it.”
Trump welcomed legislation passed by the US House that will help fund paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing and other measures to help Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
“It will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus,” he said.
Nonetheless, the administration’s response remains subject to criticism, particularly after the press conference on Friday. There, Trump announced a national emergency, paving the way for billions of dollars to be made accessible to authorities attempting to slow the pandemic.
“It opened up avenues we would never be able to open up without it,” he said at the Saturday briefing. “It will make more than $50bn available to us in disaster relief funds. And that’s available for states, territories and local governments. A lot of people are benefiting from it.”
But on Friday Trump also announced a new self-diagnosis website created by Google, only for the tech giant to deny the project was on anything like the scale outlined; said “I don’t take responsibility at all” when asked why the US lagged behind other countries in testing; and reacted angrily to a question about why a White House office for pandemic response was closed in 2018.
According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), there are 1,629 cases of coronavirus in the US with 41 deaths, and 46 states and the District of Columbia have reported infections. Other estimates, including Trump’s, are higher.
Concerns have been expressed that the US does not have enough hospital beds or ventilators. As many as 20% of coronavirus infections could require patients to receive mechanical ventilation. If estimates of more than 1m infections prove accurate, there could be more than 200,000 such cases.
According to a Johns Hopkins study based on data from 2010, US acute care hospitals own about 62,000 full-featured ventilators. The study, published in February, reported an additional 98,000 that can provide basic function.
The CDC Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) has an estimated 8,900 ventilators. At the White House on Friday, Trump said: “We have ordered a large number of respirators just in case.”
Across the US, authorities have declared emergencies, closed schools and restricted public gatherings. In New York City the largest public school system in the US remains open, a key support for millions. Pressure on the mayor, Bill de Blasio, is increasing.
New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced on Saturday that the state had recorded its first coronavirus fatality, an 82-year-old woman with pre-existing medical issues. Cuomo said the state had 524 confirmed cases, 117 hospitalised, but said officials believe thousands have the virus.
On Capitol Hill, the relief bill passed just before 1am, after two days of talks between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Agreement came after Trump signaled his support.
Pelosi thanked Democrats for their patience. Trump and the speaker never communicated directly and Trump did not thank Pelosi directly on Saturday.
The legislation now goes to the Senate. It ensures free testing for those who need it while increasing access to benefits including family medical leave, paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, spending on health insurance for the poor and food programmes for children and the elderly.
On Friday, a federal judge blocked an administration attempt to force nearly 700,000 people off food stamps, a key benefit for poor Americans. District court judge Beryl Howell cited the coronavirus outbreak and said the attempted action was capricious, arbitrary and probably unlawful.
The economic impact of the impact continued, meanwhile, as ​​Apple announced that all stores outside China would close ​for two weeks."

Toby Helm Observer political editor","Opinium survey shows fear of nation – but finds just 53% are washing their hands moreCoronavirus – latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage

The public trusts coronavirus information and advice given by Britain’s leading medical experts far more than statements by politicians, according to an opinion poll on how people are reacting to the pandemic.
While the government is seen, overall, as having handled the crisis well – with 44% approving and 30% disapproving of its reaction – the survey by Opinium for the Observer shows people have more faith in those with medical and scientific knowledge than they have in the nation’s political leaders.
Fewer than two in five (36%) said they trusted what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on the subject, while just 37% trusted the information given by the health secretary, Matt Hancock.
However, 59% said they placed their faith in the chief medical adviser to the UK government, Chris Whitty, and 55% said they would trust the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The findings suggest that the government has been wise to put Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, at the forefront of its public information campaign as it tries to promote awareness and minimise the effects of Covid-19.
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.
Justin McCurry
Seven in 10 people say they have changed aspects of their behaviour in some way since the virus began to spread. About 28% say they have stopped shaking hands, 20% have stopped touching their own faces and 18% have postponed making plans for holidays, while 8% have cancelled holidays already booked.
Despite the fact that the prime minister and medical experts have said washing hands regularly is the most important step people can take, only 53% of those asked said they were doing so more than they usually do. Almost three-quarters of people (73%) said they were now worried about the virus. About 47% of UK adults thought the virus would have a negative effect on their own finances, up from 34% at the start of the week. About 80% thought it would have a negative effect on the national economy.
There is now a widespread belief among the public that the virus will strike them or those close to them. Two in five (42%) think it is likely that they will catch the virus themselves, while 46% think a close family member will catch it. Half (51%) think a colleague will catch it.
The public is very divided when asked if the government has done enough to combat the virus. In London, where the proportion already struck by the virus is highest, people are most likely to say the authorities have not done enough. Across the country as a whole, about 41% think the government’s response has been proportionate, against 40% who say it has “underreacted”. But in London, only 32% think its reaction has been proportionate, with 55% saying it has not done enough.
The public also appears to be reconciled to the idea that more drastic measures will need to be taken soon. About 76% think flights from virus hotspots will need to be banned, and 68% think handwash and toilet paper will need to be rationed. About 44% think schools will need to be closed, against 26% who think this would be unnecessary.
Adam Drummond of Opinium said that while more people approved of the government’s response than had a negative view of it, public opinion could switch if the situation worsened dramatically.
“The fact that only 42% believe that they will contract coronavirus while the government’s strategy assumes that a significantly higher proportion will become infected means there is the risk of a nasty shock for a substantial slice of the electorate,” he said.

More than 126,000 people globally have now been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, out of whom 67,000 have recovered, and more than 4,600 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
During the first wave of infections in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analysed data from 44,672 people who had the virus. This research showed that 80.9% of patients experienced mild symptoms, 13.8% required hospitalisation and experienced severe symptoms, and 4.7% were critical cases requiring intensive care.
Although Covid-19 has spread to 116 countries, the vast majority of cases have been confirmed in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, where the pandemic originated. Taken with the 110,000 cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, this amounts to 87% of cases in total.
The rate of infection in Italy has been observed to be similar to that of Hubei. The extraordinary efforts of the Chinese state to contain the virus seem to have slowed the spread of the disease in a population used to authoritarian government. Italy’s government has ordered all shops, bars and restaurants across the country to close and has restricted travel in order to slow the outbreak.
Local factors relating to healthcare systems, availability of testing for the virus, population demographics and government interventions will all have a bearing on the course of the disease in every country in which it appears. The largest European outbreak is in Italy, where 23% of the population is aged over 65 and where 6% of cases have resulted in a fatality. Major outbreaks are also occurring in South Korea and Iran where there are fewer older people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%. In 2002, Sars spread to 37 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. The Spanish flu was the deadliest pandemic in history, killing up to 100 million people between 1918 and 1920."

Orderly, dour, cowed: how my beloved Italy is changed by coronavirus
",by  Tobias Jones,"Holed up with his family in their Parma flat, our writer tells of the eerie atmosphere in a country usually known for sociability, chaos and fun


Sun 15 Mar 2020 10.15 GMT


Since the whole of Italy was put in quarantine last Monday, it has been surreal here in the northern city of Parma. When you wander around the alleys and squares, you begin to feel like the protagonist of a post-apocalyptic film, constantly asking yourself, “Where is everyone?”
If you do see a solitary human, their reaction is diffidence, if not alarm: they adjust their face mask and move away. The habitual warmth of Italians has been replaced by self-preserving coolness. A very touchy-feely country is now obsessed by personal space.
That eerie sense of living in the end times only increases when you watch the news. Prison riots erupted across the country last week. There was a mass break-out in Foggia (six inmates are still at large). At Milan’s San Vittore prison, black smoke was seen gushing from the windows, and seven inmates died in violence in Modena. The police patrols and blockades only make things feel more ominous.
Free movement within a borderless Europe already seems like a distant memory: there were 90km queues on the Brenner pass (into Austria) last week, and Slovenia has blocked its roads with Italy. It is understandable that Italy, the country with the highest rate of coronavirus infections outside China, should be isolated, but to Italians it feels as if the country is being left to rot. Italy has received more aid from China than from the US or the EU.
Every day the numbers of Italy’s infections and deaths leap by 20% or 30%. Parma is in the Emilia-Romagna region, where so far more than 2,000 people have tested positive and more than 200 have died. In the province of Parma there have been more than 518 cases. One of those, Giovanna, is a close family friend. It feels as if the darkness just keeps getting closer.
The intensive care units are now all full. Hospital wards are spilling out into corridors, tents, car parks, gardens and commercial warehouses. We are hearing words – like “triage” – which are usually associated with warfare. Medics and nurses are having to make decisions on which patients to prioritise. Some doctors have died, and others have compared the numbers of admissions to dealing with “an earthquake every day”.
Part of the weirdness comes from that fact that you can’t go anywhere. Museums, gyms, schools, cinemas and libraries are all closed. Your instinct is to hunker down with the wider family, but all the advice is to stay away from the older generation, who are the most vulnerable to infection. You can’t gather round those who, like Giovanna, are ill. Not even her ailing husband is allowed close to her. You can’t go to church because they, too, are now closed. I would like to head to my mother-in-law’s house in the hills, but we’re not allowed out of the city.
It’s amazing how quickly you become used to new habits: not getting in the lift with other people or standing well apart in a queue (normally we’re bunched tight to foil the queue-bargers). When you ask a shopkeeper for a loaf of bread, they put it on the counter then step away. You pick it up, pay and step away. They put your change out and move back as you move forward. You feel like repelling magnets.
Some friends are fretful, washing their hands every half-hour or putting on surgical gloves to open doors. It’s hard not to begin to doubt your own sanity and wonder whether it’s rational to be following all these restrictions and rituals.
Then, last Wednesday night, another emergency decree ramped up the restrictions: all shops, except chemists and food stores, were ordered to remain closed. If you want to leave the house, you now have to print off a document to explain to police your timing, destination and motive.
In some ways it feels a little as you might imagine the Middle Ages. It’s as if we’re inside a city with metaphorical walls where rumours abound: that a friend, Marco, has a rasping cough; that politician Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive; that our kids will have to attend school throughout Italy’s baking summer. And Parma feels medieval because it is so quiet. I’ve never known it so safe to cycle around an Italian city. It’s as if the cars, as well as the humans, are keeping their distance.
So everything feels softer somehow. I never knew there was someone in the next block of flats who played the guitar. You can hear them strumming late at night. The natural world – all the turtle doves and cherry blossom – seems brighter or emboldened. That quietness extends to the football. Watching Juventus v Inter Milan the other night (before Serie A, too, was suspended) you could hear, in the absence of the crowds, almost everything from the actual game: the laces on leather, the players’ groans, shouts and insults. It made them seem mortal, like Sunday league players. Now, of course, several players – Juventus’s Daniele Rugani and the former Southampton (now Sampdoria) striker Manolo Gabbiadini – have tested positive.
What’s intriguing is that all the adjectives you might normally use to describe Italy (sociable, excitable, chaotic, undisciplined, polemical, fun and – despite all its troubles – somehow optimistic) have become redundant. It feels completely the opposite: isolated, calm, orderly, obedient, cowed, dour and pessimistic. It’s as if the country has suddenly discovered a different, maybe deeper, side. It’s a sterner, more serious place.
It’s sombre, of course, because there have now been more than 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy. There’s bafflement at the fact that the mortality rate here is (at time of writing) 7.17% compared with 0.05% in Sweden and 0.2% in Germany. We don’t understand why we’ve got it so bad, whether it’s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56.
There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a moratorium on mortgage payments, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country’s cassa integrazione) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated €25bn.
The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy’s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before – 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy’s biggest banks – Intesa and Unicredit – saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank offered no assistance to the country. The response from Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. “We need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,” he seethed.
Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I’m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi’s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma’s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: “Italy will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.”
So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the “silly Eye-ties” had messed things up again. “They’ll never follow the rules,” said some.
Prejudices about Italy – assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus – meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for “draconian” measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record.
From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world’s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes.
Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy’s literary canon – Alessandro Manzoni’s The Betrothed and Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy’s lead – closing schools, universities and sports events – we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated.
Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there’s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom.
We’re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise.
Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we’re shamelessly giving them domestic chores. They’re cleaning the fridge and the windows, mopping the floors and hanging out laundry. I’m also setting them daily challenges with a didactic dad’s earnestness: if they want to watch TV they have to learn the Nato phonetic alphabet (three passes), the names and dates of the Plantagenet monarchs (two passes), how to tie knots (three passes) or a Shakespeare soliloquy (only one pass). I’m learning quite a lot myself.
But you do wonder what’s going through their minds. Quite apart from the fear, they’re dealing with disappointments which, at their age, must seem huge. Benedetta had won, along with her dance troupe, an international ballet competition, the prize for which was to dance in New York in April. That won’t now happen. Emma, Mozart-obsessed, was due to go with her grandmother to the opera house in Giuseppe Verdi’s birthplace, Busseto, to see The Marriage of Figaro. That, too, has been cancelled. She has started playing melancholic Chopin instead of playful Mozart. Leonardo, like me, just longs to be able to play football again. In our manic matches of indoor one-aside, we’ve accidentally pruned the Victoria spiderworts and smashed the odd lightbulb.
They’re finding new passions too. They love playing euchre and blackjack, betting with matchsticks. Leo is teaching himself Spanish and now calls me el padre or hombre. Benedetta is sewing, she says from behind her bedroom door, a suit jacket. Emma is pretending to get fit. It’s all fairly wholesome in a Waltons kind of way. But they are, like us, getting cabin fever. We don’t know when this is going to end or what the outside world will look like when it does.
There have been eight deaths so far in Parma and, we assume, there will be many more. Parma is a small city. With more than 518 cases, almost everyone has a friend or friend-of-a-friend who is ill. It’s less important, perhaps, but many businesses, too, will go under.
Everyone is trying to be resilient. Children across the country are hanging out paintings on balconies saying andrà tutto bene (everything will be fine). There have been many goosebump moments, like the spontaneous singing of whole streets, the voices joining in complex harmonies through the open windows. There have been laughs: one Roman market stallholder wore a wide, plywood doughnut to guarantee personal distance. But it feels like gallows humour and the songs sound mournful.
Since we’ve been in lockdown, spring has erupted. You can see pinky-white bursts of magnolias lining the empty roads. Daises, primroses and dandelions are suddenly brightening the grass. It even smells like spring. The Parma air is, for once, so clean you can see the snow-capped Apennines from my study. It only makes you keener to get out.
But until this emergency lockdown ends, we will – except for rare excursions – experience the world like prisoners, from the windows of our cells.

The authorities of Italy’s Lombardy region, worst hit by the coronavirus, have accused the Civil Protection of having provided hospitals with “cheap masks that look like dust-cloths”.
 On Friday, the Civil Protection provided 250,000 masks for doctors and nurses of Lombardy who refused to wear them citing they were “useless”. The regional authorities compaed them to dust-cloths.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have a national production of masks,” the head of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, told the Sole24Ore newspaper.
Italy is running out of masks after the outbreak of the coronavirus. In the country’s pharmacies, the Fp2 and Fp3 masks are practically impossible to find.
Last week, the Guardian visited the open-air market, in Ballarò, in Palermo, where some street vendors had set up stalls selling packages containing 14 masks for five euros. From the photographs taken by the Guardian, it can be seen how the masks are the same as those the Civil Protection has provided to Lombardy doctors.
The police have already seized thousands of counterfeit masks in Italy, sold for tens of euros each.

Five members of the playing squad and staff of La Liga club Valencia have tested positive for Covid-19, weeks after the team travelled to Milan for a Champions League match. 
Earlier in the day, Valencia and Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay became the first La Liga player to confirm that he has the virus.
“It’s clear that I’ve got off to the wrong start in 2020,” Garay, 33, wrote on Instagram. “I’ve tested positive for the coronavirus. I feel very good and now I just have to listen to the health authorities and remain isolated.”
The club said the four others who tested positive are in self-isolation and are in good health. 
Spain is the second hardest-hit country in Europe, after Italy, and went into a near lockdown on Saturday. All organised football in Spain has been postponed for at least two weeks in a bid to prevent further spread of the virus.

A gathering at a mosque in Malaysia that attracted 16,000 attendees has been linked to a major spike in infections in the country, as well as clusters of cases elsewhere.
On Sunday, officials in Malaysia confirmed that 190 new patients had been identified, the biggest leap in cases in the country yet, making it the worst-hit nation in Southeast Asia. The majority of the new patients have been linked to the recent religious gathering, which drew people from several countries two weeks ago.
Health officials in Malaysia said on Friday that they were working around the clock to conduct mass testing of attendees, while other governments in the region have also urged citizens who were present to monitor for symptoms and get tested.
In Brunei, 40 people who traveled to the event are now reported to have the virus, while five attendees in Singapore are also infected. The news prompted the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore to close all mosques for at least five days to limit transmission and allow for cleaning.
Thailand has urged citizens who traveled to the gathering to get tested as soon as possible. Indonesia has told hundreds of its citizens who attended to monitor their health and get tested if they are ill.
Malaysia has so far managed to identify about 4,900 out of 14,500 citizens who attended the event, according to Bloomberg. The health and defence ministries will meet on Monday to discuss further measures to stop the spread of the virus, which has so far infected 428 people in the country.

All pubs and bars in the Republic of Ireland have been ordered to close from Sunday evening to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.
In a statement, the government said: “Following discussions today with the Licenced Vintners Association (LVA) and the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Government is now calling on all public houses and bars (including hotel bars) to close from this evening (Sunday 15th March) until at least 29 March.
“The LVA and VFI outlined the real difficulty in implementing the published Guidelines on Social Distancing in a public house setting, as pubs are specifically designed to promote social interaction in a situation where alcohol reduces personal inhibitions.
“For the same reason, the Government is also calling on all members of the public not to organise or participate in any parties in private houses or other venues which would put other people’s health at risk.”
No indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people applies to pubs & clubs. Have asked NPHET for further expert guidance on this. May seek enforcement powers from Dail/Seanad.

A fugitive boss of the calabrese Mafia was arrested, on Friday, thanks to the lockdown imposed by the Italian government to contain the coronavirus. 
Cesare Antonio Cordì, 42, emerging boss of the Locri clan, in Calabria, has been wanted since last July and accused of fraudulent money transfer. The man was hiding in a villa in the countryside of Locri. The police have been busy, for days, on the checks to enforce the lockdown and the ban on going out, except in cases of extreme necessity. The day before, they stopped a man with shopping bags who justified himself saying he was only bringing the groceries to a friend who could not go out.
The police were suspicious of the fact that, in that area, almost all the villas were uninhabited. In the following hours, they followed him and found the shopping was destined for the boss Cordì.
To arrest him, the intervention of a special military unit was necessary. It consists of elite and highly trained soldiers, known as the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron, or the Cacciatori, literally: the hunters.
According to investigators, Cordì is a mobster on the rise in the fierce Locri clan and the subject of a recent investigation by the Calabrian prosecutors.
Thousands of citizens have been reported for violating the ban on staying at home, according to data from the Ministry of the Interior.
In Sciacca, Sicily, a Covid-19 positive man who was forbidden from going out, was discovered by the police, while shopping. The Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation and accused the man of “aiding the epidemic”. If convicted, he faces 12 years in prison.

There is outrage in Brazil this afternoon after the country’s far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, ignored medical advice to leave his presidential palace and greet supporters outside - despite supposedly having been placed in isolation on Friday because he is waiting to take another coronavirus test.
At least four close Bolsonaro aides or officials have been diagnosed with the illness since returning from a trip to the US last week and Brazil’s president is set to take another test next week following confused reports last week that initially suggested he had tested positive for Covid-19.Despite this, Bolsonaro decided to greet and touch supporters on Sunday during controversial anti-democracy protests which he has been promoting.Bolsonaro also tweeted videos and photos egging on pro-Bolsonaro protests across the country - despite the risks of such gatherings given the spread of coronavirus in the South American country.
Bolsonaro’s decision sparked fury among opponents and ordinary citizens who are increasingly alarmed about the spread of coronavirus in Brazil. Major cities including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo have begun announcing strict measures such as the closure of schools and cinemas in a bid to contain the crisis.“President Bolsonaro is promoting corona day,” tweeted Vera Magalhães, a prominent journalist and political commentator.“Bolsonaro must be detained immediately,” tweeted the rockstar Lobão, a former supporter who has become one of the president’s most ferocious critics.In an editorial published on Sunday morning, a leading Brazilian newspaper lamented: “The major crisis Brazil now faces isn’t the stuttering economy or the threat of coronavirus. The real crisis is lacking a government when it is needed most”

The Trump administration has offered a German medical company “large sums of money” for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine, German media have reported.
The German government is trying to fight off what it sees as an aggressive takeover bid by the US, the broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles.
The US president had offered the Tübingen-based biopharmaceutical company CureVac “large sums of money” to gain exclusive access to their work, wrote Die Welt.
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.
Justin McCurry
According to an anonymous source quoted in the newspaper, Trump was doing everything to secure a vaccine against the coronavirus for the US, “but for the US only”.
The German government was reportedly offering its own financial incentives for the vaccine to stay in the country.
When approached about the report by the Guardian, the German health ministry would only confirm the accuracy of the quotes attributed to one of its spokespersons in the article.
“The federal government is very interested in vaccines and antiviral agents against the novel coronavirus being developed in Germany and Europe,” the spokesperson quoted in the original article had said. “In this regard the government is in an intensive exchange with the company CureVac.”
The German health ministry spokesperson declined the opportunity to correct any inaccuracies in Die Welt’s account.
With its headquarters in the south-western German city of Tübingen, CureVac also has sites in Frankfurt and Boston in the US. Linked with the German health ministry, it works closely with the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a research institution and medical regulatory body that is subordinate to the German health ministry.
On 11 March, CureVac released a statement that its CEO, the US citizen Daniel Menichella, was unexpectedly leaving the firm and would be replaced by the company’s founder, Ingmar Hoerr.
At the start of the month, Menichella was invited to the White House in Washington to discuss strategy for the rapid development and production of a coronavirus vaccine with Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and members of the White House coronavirus task force.
The White House has been contacted for comment.

People in some states could face hefty fines if they do not comply with new government restrictions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, with the prime minister announcing strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days. 
Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus.
The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening.
A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman – a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge – died on Saturday.
NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57.
Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61.
Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people.
State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made.
Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against “static, non-essential” mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday, although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger “widescale” closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces.
“We will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,” Morrison said.
“All people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days.
“Further, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.”
Morrison said that – until now – self-isolation had been a “voluntary arrangement” with “no potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement”.
“That will change,” he said, although penalties would be “a matter for the states and territories”.
“If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.”
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state’s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made.
Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday’s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved.
But she said it would be difficult to monitor “every situation” and the government would be relying on “public goodwill” to ensure the rules were followed and the government would “prefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation”.
“If you’re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,” Berejiklian said.
The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000.
“To date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,” she said.
The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included “severe fines”, for people who breached the self-isolation rules.
By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing.
“The states and territories … are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.”
Morrison said the government’s national information campaign “is running and it will be available to all Australians” but claimed that social distancing was “pretty straightforward”.
He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean “ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they’re close family and friends”. “It’s all commonsense.”
For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them.
“If we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,” he said.
Morrison foreshadowed that there “will be further intrusions, further restrictions on people’s movement and their behaviour” in future in response to changes in medical advice.
The first of these will be new protocols for visiting aged care facilities, he said, with further work to be done to protect remote communities in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that school closures are regarded as inevitable, prompting many schools and universities to prepare for shutdowns.
But Morrison said there were “very good reasons” against moving to “broadscale closures of schools” at this point.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, schools should stay open at this time because taking children out may expose others to risk and would “put at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community”, he said. “The states and territories are not moving in that direction.”
The issue will be revisited at meetings of the national cabinet on Tuesday and Friday, although individual schools in Victoria and NSW have been allowed to close “based on the cases presented there in the circumstances that exist in those communities”, he said.
Earlier on Sunday Murphy and the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that as advice changes, measures might escalate to include general lockdowns.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” Murphy told ABC’s Insiders. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
Labor has criticised the government for the slow pace of rolling out a national information campaign, and on Sunday the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for further support for the aviation sector, which missed out on funding in the $1bn regional and community fund.
“While these measures are necessary for public health, the federal government must urgently address the significant consequences for our aviation sector,” she said.
“With conditions changing rapidly and no end in sight, the federal government must urgently provide all necessary support to ensure Australia has a vibrant aviation sector once the coronavirus outbreak has passed.”"

I’m an epidemiologist. When I heard about Britain’s ‘herd immunity’ coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire
","Your house is on fire, and the people whom you have trusted with your care are not trying to put it out. Even though they knew it was coming, and could see what happened to the neighbours as they were overwhelmed with terrifying speed, the UK government has inexplicably chosen to encourage the flames, in the misguided notion that somehow they will be able to control them.","

When I first heard about this, I could not believe it. I research and teach the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health. My colleagues here in the US, even as they are reeling from the stumbling response of the Donald Trump administration to the crisis, assumed that reports of the UK policy were satire – an example of the wry humour for which the country is famed. But they are all too real.
Let me take the arguments on their merits. The stated aim has been to achieve “herd immunity” in order to manage the outbreak and prevent a catastrophic “second wave” next winter – even if Matt Hancock has tried to put that particular genie back in the bottle this weekend. A large proportion of the population is at lower risk of developing severe disease: roughly speaking anyone up to the age of 40. So the reasoning goes that even though in a perfect world we’d not want anyone to take the risk of infection, generating immunity in younger people is a way of protecting the population as a whole.
We talk about vaccines generating herd immunity, so why is this different? Because this is not a vaccine. This is an actual pandemic that will make a very large number of people sick, and some of them will die. Even though the mortality rate is likely quite low, a small fraction of a very large number is still a large number. And the mortality rate will climb when the NHS is overwhelmed. This would be expected to happen, even if we make the generous assumption that the government were entirely successful in restricting the virus to the low-risk population, at the peak of the outbreak the numbers requiring critical care would be greater than the number of beds available. This is made worse by the fact that people who are badly ill tend to remain so for a long time, which increases the burden.
And of course you can’t restrict it to this age group. Think of all the people aged between 20 and 40 who work in healthcare, or old people’s homes. You don’t need many introductions into settings like these for what we might coyly call “severe outcomes”. In Washington State, nearly all the deaths reported so far have been associated with nursing homes. Is everyone in a high-risk group supposed to withdraw themselves from society for six months until they can emerge once the (so far entirely imaginary) second wave has been averted?
About that second wave: let me be clear. Second waves are real things, and we have seen them in flu pandemics. This is not a flu pandemic. Flu rules do not apply. There might well be a second wave, I honestly don’t know. But vulnerable people should not be exposed to a virus right now in the service of a hypothetical future.
Keeping people safe means self-isolation if you develop symptoms, but the official advice here is also misleading. While it is of paramount importance that sick people stay at home to avoid infecting others, it is increasingly clear that transmission can occur before symptoms develop. We know this is true from modelling and observational studies. I have seen it happen myself. We do not know how often it occurs or how important it is in the epidemiology, but it definitely does happen.
However, arguments about the case fatality rate, the transmission parameters and presymptomatic transmission all miss the point. This virus is capable of shutting down countries. You should not want to be the next after Wuhan, Iran, Italy or Spain. In those places, the healthcare systems have broken down. In Italy, the choices of whom to save and whom to allow to die are real. You should instead look to the example of South Korea, which, through a combination of intense surveillance and social distancing, appears to have gained some semblance of control over the virus. We can learn from South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, all of which have so far done a good job mitigating the worst outcomes despite having reported cases early in the pandemic, and in the case of South Korea, suffering a substantial outbreak.
The UK should not be trying to create herd immunity, that will take care of itself. Policy should be directed at slowing the outbreak to a (more) manageable rate. What this looks like is strong social distancing. Anyone who can work from home, should. People who do not yet work from home should be encouraged to do so. Employers should guarantee sick pay, including for contacts of known cases, and do everything they can to discourage the practice of “presenteeism”. You should not shake hands. Not with anyone. You should wash your hands for 20 seconds several times a day and whenever you enter your home (or someone else’s home). Call a halt to large gatherings. Educate people about masks and how they should be reserved for the medical professionals who need them. All this and more should have started weeks ago.
Deciding whether to close schools is hard; they do so much more than just education. But this is a pandemic, and so you should expect they will be shut sooner or later. In Hong Kong, they have been shut for weeks. If you hear any talking head on TV explain that kids don’t get sick, remember that doesn’t mean kids cannot be infected and transmit. It’s probably a good idea to hold off on visits to Nana and Grandpa.
The most fundamental function of a government is to keep its people safe. It is from this that it derives its authority, the confidence of the people and its legitimacy. Nobody should be under the illusion that this is something that can be dodged through somehow manipulating a virus that we are only beginning to understand. This will not pass you by; this is not a tornado, it is a hurricane.
Don’t panic, but do prepare. If your government won’t help you, do it yourself.

Paul Karp","Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says school closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food are ‘premature’ at the moment

School closures and stockpiling a fortnight’s food to prepare for coronavirus self-isolation are “premature” for the general population, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, have said, though all options are on the table.
Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin “practising” to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly.
Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required.
Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight’s worth of food.
Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing.
On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled.
Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports “or things of that nature”.
On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government’s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a “six-month window” although it “might be longer”.
Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others.
“It – it is potential that could be the case,” he said. “But that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.”
Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: “Potentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.”
“There are no options that are off the table,” Hunt said. “The paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.”
Murphy said authorities were “strongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call ‘social distancing’.
“So that’s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact … not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.”
Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more “may well change” but Australia, which he said had “only 250 cases”, was still “ahead of the curve”.
“If you’re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should … [exercise] more social distancing,” he said, and “avoid things that aren’t essential”.
Murphy said for others the risk of attending public places with fewer than 500 people, such as a cinema, was still at this stage “relatively low” and at the moment authorities were not recommending people stop taking the train. As case numbers increase, the medical advice will respond to recommend greater social distancing, he said.
“I think the gym is fine but everybody at the moment needs to practise very good hygiene.
“If you’re going to the gym, I would be very focused on hand washing, using hand sanitisers, all of those social distancing, good hygiene measures, we want everybody in the community to start practising those.”
Asked about the Victorian chief medical officer’s suggestion people should stockpile a fortnight’s worth of food, Murphy replied it was “a little bit premature at the moment”.
“For most people we don’t want to encourage major panic buying at the moment – we’ve seen that with the supermarket chains. But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.”
Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice.
He said governments did not want to “move too early” because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and “taking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains”.
Murphy said there was “no question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they’ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time”. “So you don’t want to move too early.”
Murphy said there were “very few reports of symptomatic infection in children” and authorities don’t know “whether children are getting infected but just don’t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they’re not getting infected”. “The former is probably more likely.”
Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity.
Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they’re feeling unwell.
Murphy said Australian authorities define “close contact” – which requires self-isolation – as “someone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before”.
He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are “very, very unlikely to have been infectious”.
On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was “aghast” at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response.
Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy’s advice on hand shaking was “inconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying” and argued there is “no coherent advice” about whether schools should open from Monday.
Bowtell said the government appeared to “have no plan” for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was “imperative” to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals.
Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday.
Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an “abundance of caution” and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined.
Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined “the relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March”, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday’s meeting.
On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a “national cabinet” made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday.
So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn.
The Morrison government has set up a new coronavirus business unit in the Treasury to support business confidence, employment and business continuity."

Kim Willsher","French minister says patients should take paracetamol rather than ibuprofen or cortisone

First published on Sat 14 Mar 2020 15.47 GMT


French authorities have warned that widely used over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen the coronavirus.
The country’s health minister, Olivier Véran, who is a qualified doctor and neurologist, tweeted on Saturday: “The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone … ] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”
Health officials point out that anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system.
The health ministry added that patients should choose paracetamol – which is known in the US by the generic name acetaminophen and commonly by the brand name Tylenol – because “it will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation”.
French patients have been forced to consult pharmacies since mid-January if they want to buy popular painkillers, including ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin, to be reminded of the risks.
Jean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, told RTL radio: “Anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of complications when there is a fever or infection.”
The French health ministry announced on Friday evening that the number of coronavirus case in the country had increased by 800 in 24 hours. Véran said there were 3,661 confirmed cases that had lead to 79 deaths. Of the sick, 154 people are in intensive care.
Véran said in his daily briefing that the evolution and spread of the virus was “rapid and real”, but that 98% of those who had tested positive had recovered.
The Eiffel Tower, Château de Versailles, Louvre, Musée d’Orsay and Centre Pompidou are among the public attractions that have closed. The archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, said there would be no Sunday masses held in churches in the Paris region.
About 400 gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, gathered in Paris for “Act 70”, the 70th consecutive Saturday of protests since November 2018. An authorised march from Montparnasse station to Bercy, where the economy ministry is situated, is expected to go ahead. Public gatherings of more than 100 people have been banned in France, but it has been reported that demonstrations are exempt.
Schools closed across the country after lessons on Saturday, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home. The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus by internet. “This coming period is not one in which the youngsters don’t have to work,” he told BFMTV."

Even at their most effective – and draconian – containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.
About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials in April.
This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.
But there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus – flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk – vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on “prototype” pathogens. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.
Coronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.
Sars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars – hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung – the same type of receptor in both cases – allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.
All vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.
Traditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy – the one that Novavax is using, for example – constructs a “recombinant” vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast – forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another Boston company, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.
Cepi’s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (£3.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. “Our experience with vaccine development is that you can’t anticipate where you’re going to stumble,” says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way.
Clinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there’s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. “Not all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,” says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and is collaborating with Cepi over a Covid-19 vaccine.
There are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they’re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can’t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material – RNA or DNA – has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: “While there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it’s really important not to take shortcuts.”
An illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.
It’s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November – an impossible deadline. “Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That’s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.
In the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it’s going to be needed in vast quantities – and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don’t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don’t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.
Once a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. “Getting a vaccine that’s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what’s needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.”
The problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk – including children and pregnant women – with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.
Because pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India – a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world – not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.
Outside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes – leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: “The question is, what will happen in a situation where you’ve got national emergencies going on?”
This is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, “will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available”. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating – like flu – and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible. To repeat the sage advice: wash your hands."

The acid test of Trump's maverick leadership has come – can he save himself?
","
David Smith in Washington","The president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been ‘haphazard’, from a cascade of false statements to a public address that fueled anxiety


Sun 15 Mar 2020 06.00 GMT


With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America.
Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making.
Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens – household names in America – will provide “drive-thru” testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance.
This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing.
The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump’s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump’s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk.
The acid test of Trump’s maverick leadership has finally come.
His response so far has been “haphazard”, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “When you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.”
Trump’s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. His discomfort on this topic was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it.
“Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” he said. “I don’t know anything about it.”
Trump’s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.
Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a “Keep America Great Again” cap, boasting of his “natural ability” to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.
On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers’ estimation, an unmitigated disaster, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.
Then came Friday’s rose garden reset. Trump declared a national emergency that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.
His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.
“This day should be an inspiration to every American,” he said, “because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing an all-of-America approach.
“Mr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China … throughout this process, Mr President, you’ve put the health of America first.”
It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?
There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points – its biggest point gain ever.
Furthermore, the are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump’s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, said: “I think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China]. The rollout of the kits and the testing was a step backwards but now they seem to be getting their footing back.”
His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk
Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: “He gets mixed reviews. His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk. Where he got good reviews lies in the government’s overall approach.”
Whalen noted that California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship.
Newsom told reporters: “We had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: ‘We’re gonna do the right thing’ and ‘You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise’. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.”
Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November’s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting.
It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush’s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Whalen said: “The question is how does he handle this as on a personal level. For Bush, the problem with Katrina wasn’t the federal response but Bush not getting out of the plane, not showing the personal touch. Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he’d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief.
“The economy is his trump card at all times. There are people who say: ‘I may not care for the tweets or his bombastic bluster but I’m making money while he’s in office.’ But now people will get their monthly statement and ask: ‘What happened to 10% of my portfolio?’”"

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.
No. In the UK, the medical advice is now that anyone with a cough or high temperature should stay at home for seven days, keeping away from other people, including those in your home if you can. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.
You should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.
China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. There is now extensive human to human transmission across the world.
As of 15 March, more than 156,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have been over 5,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 73,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.
We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.
Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected."

Coronavirus: airlines face meltdown as global travel bans multiply
",Coronavirus – latest updates,"American Airlines to scrap most long-haul flights while Australia orders all arrivals to self-isolate and Spain goes into lockdown

The international travel industry faces a widespread shutdown over coronavirus fears after airlines announced new flight reductions and more countries introduced travel bans and isolation requirements.
Travel businesses were hit with multiple doses of bad news on Saturday and Sunday, with the US expanding its Europe travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, a number of South American countries bringing in flight restrictions and Australia joining New Zealand in requiring all people entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days.
American Airlines, the second biggest in the world, said on Saturday that it would start implementing a phased suspension of nearly all long-haul international flights from Monday, amid reduced demand and travel restrictions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
The cruise industry also suffered another setback when two ships were placed in quarantine in Chile after an elderly British man aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced on Saturday.
The US government said on Saturday that it would “immediately” begin working on ways to help the coronavirus-hit aviation and cruise industries as they scramble to stem losses and protect jobs.
The crisis facing the industry has been accelerated by the latest extension of the US ban on incoming travel, with US vice-president Mike Pence announcing at the White House on Saturday that British and Irish travellers would also be barred from entering the US for 30 days.
At the same press conference, Donald Trump revealed that he had taken a test for the virus, with the White House later revealing that he had proved negative.
In Spain, the wife of prime minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive as her husband formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus. Spain is now the fourth-worst affected country in the world after it recorded more deaths to take the total to 196. Sánchez said the country would be placed in lockdown for two weeks and ordered people to stay at home unless they had to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital.
The outbreak also worsened in the UK on Saturday with the total of deaths nearly doubling from 11 to 21 amid continued controversy about whether the government’s policy aimed at creating “herd immunity” from the disease would work or not.
Around the world, varying measures of control continued to be imposed on populations from the Philippines, where the capital Manila was in the process of being sealed off, to Argentina where flights from countries badly hit by the virus have been halted.
The prospect of a shattering blow for the airline industry was foreshadowed by the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, as he announced that all international passenger arrivals from midnight Sunday would be legally required to self-isolate for 14 days.
The flights would dry up “very, very quickly”, he said, and set up serious concerns for the country’s $3.5bn cruise industry by adding that passenger ships from foreign ports would be banned for an initial 30 days.
Even before the new curbs were announced, the chief executive of British Airways told staff that the airline was in a “fight for survival”.
US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government would “immediately” start working with Congress to support the afflicted industries.
The US restrictions on travel to the UK and Ireland will begin on Monday at midnight, Pence said. Most non-US citizens who have been in those countries within the last 14 days will be barred from entering America. The restrictions do not bar flights to and from the US, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel.
As the curbs were revealed, United and Delta airlines said they would start cutting flights to the UK and Southwest, one of the few US airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was “seriously considering” cutting flights.
United said it would suspend flights to London from Houston and Denver starting Monday. The airline expects to fly three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin through the end of April.
United said it would give a credit for the value of the ticket for any customer whose international travel is disrupted by more than six hours because of schedule changes resulting from government restrictions. Customers who do not use the credit for 12 months will get a refund.
Between 16 March and 6 May, American will reduce its international capacity by 75% on a year-over-year basis, it said in a statement, adding that the changes will result in the airline parking nearly its entire widebody fleet. The airline also anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20% on a year-over-year basis. Domestic capacity for the month of May will be reduced by 30%, the company added.
The US Chamber of Commerce on Friday called on the government to “turn next to a package to assist impacted employers ... No business should go bankrupt because of a temporary loss in revenue as a result of the coronavirus.”
In Europe, the situation for the sector was increasingly dire.
Norwegian Air, which has built up large debts to establish itself as a low-cost transatlantic operator, said on Saturday that it had “weeks not months” to avert collapse.
KLM, the Dutch subsidiary of Air France-KLM, plans to slash up to 2,000 jobs, cut working hours by one-third for its entire staff and ask for government support.
German flagship carrier Lufthansa said on Friday it was considering a request for state aid.
In Bolivia, a ban on direct flights to and from Europe went into effect on Saturday. Travellers from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain are also banned from entry.
Panama banned flights from Asia, one day after blocking flights from Europe.
Chile, meanwhile, has quarantined more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced Saturday.
The 85-year-old man, who is reportedly in good condition in a hospital in the city of Coyhaique, showed symptoms of the virus after getting off the Silver Explorer ship in the far southern port of Caleta Tortel, 2,400 kilometres (1,500 miles) from Santiago.
The other ship, the Azmara Pursuit was currently near the port of Chacabuco after authorities banned it from landing passengers there, on grounds that it was carrying suspected cases of the coronavirus.

Australian share prices are collapsing in afternoon trade, with the benchmark ASX200 index down 6.25% at around 2.45pm.
At these levels, Tuesday’s extraordinary 5.8% gain is set to be wiped out.
Buy-now-pay-later outfit and former market darling Afterpay has been smashed to smithereens, with its share price imploding by almost a third to make it by far the biggest loser of the day so far.
It has been falling since the beginning of the coronavirus panic; shares that were changing hands at more than $40 in the middle of last month are now worth just $13.07.
All sectors except utilities have been punished today, with consumer discretionary stocks – that means things like department stores and gambling – down the most.

We have no more information than that, at this point.
But the attorney general’s point about people who have not received welfare assistance previously and may be suddenly needing some kind of help is very interesting. And it doesn’t look like whatever happens, it will be a cheque-is-in-the-mail-style stimulus:
Now, when you talk about cash, what we have said, I think fairly consistently since the beginning of this, is that the individuals we have a very deep, broad welfare system, which is a proven delivery mechanism to get people through hard times. 
Now how we might modify that welfare system for these particular and extraordinary challenges is obviously something that’s being worked on. 
But already in the first round of stimulus we’ve dealt with this issue of the pause with respect to say for instance business. 
So business being able to get in, in the first wave of the direct fiscal economic stimulus payments based on the amount of withholding tax they keep for their employees, which is a good proxy measure for the number of people they employ – of up to 25,000 – is going to allow that business if it has a downturn in demand to keep people engaged with the business, even though they’re doing less work, and get through that six months so that they can surge out the other side of it when things get better, and when things get better they’re likely to get, you know, better fairly quickly.

Christian Porter also mentioned this:
The central issue is having identified people who will need assistance, what’s the best, most efficient delivery mechanism to give that assistance? 
And with the employment issues, I mean, very, very sadly it’s going to mean for a period of time over the next six months that people who have never had any contact whatsoever with the welfare system perhaps for the entirety of their lives, will be needing of assistance from the taxpayer. 
And in fact these who up until this point have been paying the taxes that keeps the system able to offer assistance. 
So, you know, it is extraordinary, these are unprecedented times in many ways, but not issues that we’re unprepared for, they’re being dealt with quickly, but in a very orderly fashion and based on all the best evidence and data that we can get in.

Christian Porter spoke to Perth radio 6PR a little earlier today. The transcript has just come out.
He has a bit more on this switch we are seeing from “stimulus” to “safety net”.
Well I would describe the round one measures as being sort of traditional fiscal stimulus. 
I mean they were things designed to keep businesses ticking along even with reduced demand, which will be clearly the case in many sectors, I mean many sectors are going to have increased demand obviously, but traditional stimulus measures to keep the economy pushing through what will be a very challenging six months.
 What is now being considered, what I would describe more generally as safety net issues – so not so much in the nature of traditional economic stimulus designed to push the economy through a challenging time but to identify people who will be in need of assistance, whether they’re businesses or business sectors or obviously individuals and clearly we’re going to have some issues around unemployment. 
So we’re trying to look at the ways in which we can cater for what are our best estimates around the scale and depth and location of those sort of problems.

Football (soccer) is off, until at least the middle of next month. One of the Canberra clubs has put out this alert to members:
Football Federation of Australia (FFA) has announced a suspension of all football (soccer) activities until after Easter, Tuesday 14 April. 
This means there will be no training, games, meetings or any other football activities.
The decision comes as the latest in a series of measures being introduced by the FFA to combat the ongoing spread of COVID-19 following the announcement of its COVID-19 Guidelines yesterday and places the concerns, health and wellbeing of the Australian football and wider community as the highest priority.
While we are all keen to get out on the pitch and get the season underway, we must consider the health risk that the spread of the virus poses to players and their families. 
Slowing the spread of the virus is the most important thing to do now and the only way we are likely to get any chance of a season of football in 2020.

From the Dan Andrews press conference, there was also an AFL update:
The AFL is doing everything the chief health officer has asked of them. I think that’s good. 
The ghost game issue, the no crowds, that makes perfect sense. Ultimately decisions for that code, for that league, for that professional sport is a matter for those who govern it. 
It won’t be the last discussion I have with Gill [McLachlan, the AFL’s CEO]. Footy is very important, not just culturally, but as an identity thing for us, particularly as Victorians. 
It’s a big employer as well. We’ll continue to speak with the AFL.
Those matters are principally for them, and beyond that, what I’m pleased to be able to report, they’re following the advice. 
They’re doing the right thing, to listen and engage with the chief health officer, to get that advice and act with an abundance of caution. 
I think that’s really clear and AFL are doing everything the chief health officer and experts are asking of them.

ACCI said on this point:
“Many employees will have sick leave entitlements or carers leave to deal with children and family members needing care. However, the use of personal leave for isolation without illness is limited, some employees may not yet have accrued paid personal leave, some will have utilised their entitlement, and some casuals have effectively been paid in advance for such leave through an additional pay loading. In such situations there may not be a backup income where someone cannot work, although this is far from a problem with, or restricted to, casual employment.

Scott Morrison has told Australians to “stop hoarding” as he announces sweeping new measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, a global do-not-travel order, and strict new rules for visiting aged care homes.
In a massive step-up of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, the prime minister announced that a national cabinet of state and federal leaders had agreed on Tuesday night to an indefinite new ban on indoor groups of 100 people or more, with exemptions for schools, public transport, universities, prisons, courts, supermarkets and worksites.
The new measure, to be effective immediately, comes after a ban on mass gatherings of more than 500 people was put in place on Monday, prompting the widespread cancellation of sporting and cultural events.
While declaring a national human biosecurity emergency under the Biosecurity Act on Tuesday morning, Morrison ruled out an Italian-style national lockdown and urged calm, taking aim at those panic buying, saying it was “un-Australian” and unnecessary.
“Stop hoarding,” he said. “I can’t be more blunt about it. Stop it. It is not sensible, it is not helpful and it has been one of the most disappointing things I have seen in Australian behaviour in response to this crisis.
“That is not who we are as a people. It is not necessary. It is not something that people should be doing.”
The declaration under the act, which was signed off by the governor general on Tuesday morning, allows a minister to “determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary” to prevent entry or spread of a disease, with penalties for non-compliance.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has also announced level-four restrictions for all global travel, with formal advice now escalated to “do not travel overseas”, along with a call for Australians abroad to return home or risk being stranded.
Warning that the measures were likely to be in place for at least six months, Morrison stridently defended the government’s decision to keep schools open, saying that 30% of the health workforce could be disrupted if schools were shut, and jobs would be lost, with limited health benefits.
“The disruption that would occur from the closure of schools around this country, make no mistake, would be severe,” Morrison said.
“What do I mean by severe? Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more. [There would be] a 30% impact on the availability of health workers is our advice – that will put peoples’ lives at risk.”
“There is a national public interest here in keeping schools open and our advice is that is not being done at the detriment at the health of any child.”
He also said he would be sending his children to school and was happy to do so.
“There is only one reason your kids shouldn’t be going to school and that is if they are unwell,” he said.
The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, also emphasised that the virus behaved differently among young people, but said schools would still need to encourage hand-washing, practise social distancing and limit group gatherings.
“It will be hard for schools, but it would be much, much, much harder for society if the schools were closed.”
The national cabinet has also agreed to a range of restrictions on aged care home visits, including by those who have been overseas or exposed to the virus, those who have any respiratory illness or display symptoms, and school groups.
There will also be limits on social gatherings for aged care residents, and social distancing measures will be put in place.
For end-of-life situations, Morrison said arrangements would be made on a case-by-case basis, in negotiation with care facilities.
“In cases of end of life, I know that people will want to see their elderly parents or relatives or others. I totally understand that. Aged care facilities will have the discretion to put in very strict arrangements to enable people to visit their loved ones if that is the situation that that resident finds themselves in.”
Amid concern about the potential of the virus to take hold in vulnerable remote Indigenous communities, Morrison said a list of proscribed areas that would limit visitation was also being prepared by the states.
Anzac Day events and ceremonies will also be cancelled due to the higher proportion of older Australians who attend such events.
Ruling out a short-term lockdown of the country, which Murphy claimed would “achieve nothing”, Morrison warned that the measures being taken by the government would likely be in place for at least half a year.
“We are looking at a situation of at least six months for how we deal with this,” Morrison said. “It could be much longer than that. It could be shorter. That is unlikely, given the way we are seeing events unfold.”
“What we are doing, you have to be able to keep doing that and sustain that, that has to be something that is achievable for all Australians so we can keep our country running in the best possible way in the interests of all Australians.”
With 454 confirmed cases now in Australia, Murphy said the government was unsure of the current trajectory, but said there was now low-level “community transition” that would see the number of cases rise.
He emphasised the importance of social distancing and hand hygiene, urging Australians to “keep away from each other where possible”.
“No more hand shaking. No more hugging … no more scant attention to hand hygiene.”
Along with the health measures, Morrison said the government was finalising a second economic assistance package which would be focused on improving the “safety net” for affected businesses and individuals.
“The government is considering quite extensively further economic measures that will deal with the strength and the strengthening of our safety net and cushioning the even greater impact of the coronavirus on the Australian economy,” Morrison said.
“Last week we focused very much on the stimulus-type activity, encouraging investment, encouraging demand into the economy and providing support to small business. The measures that we are focusing on now are of a different nature – they are focused more on the cushioning impact of the safety net for individuals and small businesses.”
The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the opposition was inclined to support the economic stimulus package when it came before parliament next week.
“We will be supportive, make no mistake, of economic stimulus,” Albanese said.
But he said there was “urgency” to roll out health and economic measures as soon as possible, and called for more assistance for the aviation industry on top of a $715m package outlined on Wednesday.
“We know that the sooner the response, the more effective it will be and the less the cost will be in the long run,” he said."

Kyrgyzstan in central Asia has confirmed its first coronavirus cases with three citizens testing positive after arriving from Saudi Arabia, according to the health ministry, Reuters reports.
It comes a day after the mountainous country closed its borders to all foreigners. 
Kyrgyzstan borders China, where the outbreak first began in December, and two of its neighbours, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, also confirmed their first cases this month. All three countries, along with Tajikistan, have moved to ban or limit public events and suspended Friday prayers at mosques.

Staying with financial matters, we’re in for another extremely volatile day on world stock markets if the current situation in Asia Pacific is anything to go by.
The ASX200 in Sydney has taken yet another battering today, shedding nearly 5% with around an hour to go before the close. It’s a bit better in Japan (perhaps helped by Fujifilm) where the market is up 0.7%. Then we’re up in Shanghai but down in Hong Kong and Seoul.
But more significantly, the US futures market is pointing to another bad day on Wall Street despite Tuesday’s mini rally on Wall Street and on Europe’s beleaguered bourses.
The Dow Jones is set to open down 4% later on and the S&P is showing a drop of nearly 5%. 
These are massive falls. 
The problem, as identified by most market professionals, is that the US Federal Reserve can splurge all the money it wants but it can’t make a vaccine and the only thing that is going to reverse the downward trend of the markets is a flattening of the global – but especially US – infection rates.
Trihn Nguyen, Asia economist at Naxitis bank in Hong Kong, puts it very pithily:
Three limitations to the Fed: a) can’t cure the virus b) limited to supply of $$ & we still got credit squeeze & so more help on the operational side vs blanket rates; c) burned most of the wood when GDP was positive.
I love that last comment. Winter’s coming and the woodpile has gone.

This is Martin Farrer taking over the blog for a short time while Helen has a much-deserved break.
We’re keen to inject a bit of optimism into the blog when possible and there is some in a Reuters story about how shares in Fujifilm have jumpped 15% after a Chinese official said the Japanese company’s Avigan anti-flu drug appeared to help coronavirus patients recover. 
Fujifilm is obviously best known for its camera equipment but one of its subsidiaries makes a drug called Avigan, which is also known as Favipiravir. The drug was approved for use in Japan in 2014. 
Reuters says that Zhang Xinmin, an official at China’s science and technology ministry, told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that Favipiravir has been effective, with no obvious side-effects, in helping coronavirus patients recover, 
A Fujifilm spokeswoman said the company had no comment on the Chinese government’s announcement. Fujifilm manufactures Avigan only on receiving orders from the Japanese government and has no sales target for the drug, she said. Fujifilm shares closed the morning up 14.7% at 5,207 yen, having briefly hit their daily limit high of 5,238 yen.

The pet dog in Hong Kong which grabbed attention after it tested positive for Covid-19 has died after returning home to its owner.
The dog was taken into quarantine in February when its owner was diagnosed with Covid-19. 
It returned a “weak positive” result over the course of several tests. Hong Kong radio reported this morning that the dog had finally tested negative and was allowed to go home on Saturday. However the owner told officials on Monday that it had died. 
Authorities did not say how the dog had died and the owner refused permission for an autopsy.
The dog never showed symptoms or appeared ill, and a blood test showed it had no antibodies. 
Health authorities repeatedly said there was no evidence the dog could pass the disease on to a human, and they urged people to continue to care for their pets. Because the dog showed weak positive results from swabs of its nasal cavity, the concern was that the cavity was likely a contaminated surface.

More now on the casinos and other businesses closing in Las Vegas: 
The Democratic governor Steve Sisolak order Tuesday night – a monthlong closure of casinos and other non-essential businesses like bars, movie theaters and gyms – follows similar moves by more than 10 other governors as states scramble to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19. 
Sisolak’s order gave thousands of businesses a little more than two days prepare. The governor’s order follows an order the mayor of Reno issued Monday night.

In US election news - and some context for that alarming potential unemployment figure given by US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin earlier: 
“This Democratic race isn’t pining for the fjords. It is no more. It has ceased to be. Its metabolic processes are now history. This is an ex-presidential contest.
The only reason the news networks could not call the Florida primary as soon as the votes piled up for Joe Biden was because the state’s panhandle voters were still at the polls. Once those polls closed, the obvious was made official: it was a blowout for Biden.
The last time we heard from Bernie Sanders after losing big in the last round of primaries, he said he wanted to debate the former vice-president head-to-head, one-on-one, to press his case directly and finally.
The only topic the American people want to debate is the coronavirus pandemic and the severe recession that looks like the certain outcome of this quasi-national quarantine. Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could hit 20% if they didn’t push through a huge economic stimulus as soon as possible.
To put that into context, unemployment peaked at 10% after the financial collapse of 2008. It hit 24.9% in the Great Depression in 1933.

A little more on those China figures now. Mainland China reported just one new domestic case in the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday – and a dozen more infections imported from overseas. 
For the second consecutive day there was only one more fresh infection in Wuhan.
New cases in Hubei province have now been in the single digits for the past seven days.
In recent days, there has been an easing of restrictions in some parts of the province, with China saying it has “basically curbed” the spread of the virus.
An average of 20,000 people are flying into China every day, according to the government, and 10 Chinese provinces and municipalities are imposing mandatory quarantines on those arriving from abroad.
Beijing requires almost all international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels in the capital.

Thousands of foreign travellers need to leave the northern Philippines by Friday or they will be stranded in the region, which has been placed under quarantine because of a growing number of coronavirus infections, officials said Tuesday.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared an enhanced community quarantine on the main island of Luzon that requires millions of people to stay mostly at home and restricts land, air and sea travel to fight the Covid-19 disease. 
The drastic moves announced by Duterte on Monday night, which include the suspension of mass transport, caught many by surprise and sparked traffic jams and confusion in many areas. Hundreds of taxis were stopped by police along metropolitan Manilas main EDSA highway for violating the transport ban and made to wait for hours in long rows on the sidelines. Many drivers said they were unaware of the ban and were eventually allowed to leave without fines.
The Philippines has reported 187 cases of infections, according to the Department of Health, which confirmed Tuesday that one of its officials was among those infected. Fourteen people have died, the highest toll in Southeast Asia.Transport Undersecretary Raul del Rosario said foreign tourists and travelers can opt to leave Luzon, where Manila is located, within 72 hours to avoid being stranded, because all flights from the region will be suspended.When the deadline arrives, they will have no option because all flights, domestic and international, will be canceled, del Rosario told a news conference.Many passengers jammed Manilas main airport Tuesday. Some airlines have already canceled flights, complicating the problems of outbound travellers."

Most people agree we should do all we can to help those who – through no fault of their own – contract Covid-19. The government is, rightly, about to spend billions of dollars on health services to help those who need it. No one expects people to get through coronavirus on their own.
But when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who are about to lose their jobs because of Covid-19, our public policy response is not nearly so generous.
The median full-time wage in Australia is $68,000 a year. A person who is laid off from their job will land in a Newstart safety net of almost $14,500 a year. How many weeks could you pay for food, rent, mortgage or car payments on $280 a week?
For decades, governments have justified the rations we provide to the unemployed, with claims such as:
1. “Newstart isn’t like the age pension, because people don’t have to live on it for long.” Leaving aside the fact that the average bout of unemployment in Australia lasts more than 10 months, there is no doubt that over the next six months a wave of newly unemployed people will be queuing up for Newstart. And the more people that enter the ranks of the unemployed, the longer the average bout of unemployment will last.
2. “If Newstart would be ‘too generous’, people would have no incentive to look for work.” Again, leaving aside the fact there was never any strong evidence that a lack of effort or searching (as opposed to a shortage of jobs) was the cause of unemployment, surely, no one believes that an airline worker who gets stood down from their $80,000 per year job needs any more incentive to return to work than their employer allowing them to.
But just as there’s no reason to lay blame on people who need intensive care because they’ve contracted Covid-19, there is absolutely no reason to blame the retail workers, tourism workers or teachers who are likely to find themselves without an income in the coming weeks. And it’s hard to imagine why we wouldn’t help them.
Another argument for not helping the unemployed is that individuals should have prepared themselves for a “rainy day”. This argument was put most gratuitously by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, who suggested casual workers – around 40%  of whom are below 25 years old – should have “already made provisions” for an event like being told they can’t work for 14 days because of a global health pandemic. No wonder people think the government is out of touch.
But luckily for the unemployed, the once-fiscally conservative Coalition are desperately looking for new things to spend money on so they can prevent GDP, and their polling numbers, crashing too badly.
There are currently around 734,000 people on Newstart. And while far from generous, the age pension is a full 54% higher than Newstart, at $430.30 per week. If we boosted the income of those on Newstart by the $10,000 difference between their payment and the age pension, the cost over 12 months would only be around $7.3bn.
But of course we shouldn’t stop with the unemployed. For the course of this crisis we should boost the weekly incomes of all beneficiaries, all of whom are among the lower state income earners, and all of whom will struggle with less casual work and the higher costs for staples.
The government has already announced its first $17.6bn stimulus package and is reportedly working on its second. There might even be a third and fourth round of stimulus, as the length of this pandemic makes itself apparent. Given the obvious needs of those with the least work and on the lowest incomes, and given the government’s need to pump money into the economy, there is literally no argument against boosting Newstart payments other than “they don’t deserve it”.
But no one “deserves” to get Covid-19. And no one deserves to lose their job or stay stuck in unemployment because of Covid-19 either.
Australia is one of the richest countries in the world. While we have high levels of household debt we have very low levels of public debt. State and federal governments will likely borrow more than $100bn over the course of this health crisis. That’s a very good thing.
Decades of political sloganeering have convinced large sections of the media, and of the population, that government borrowing is wasteful, a burden on future generations, or both. But – as all of the media and all of the population are about to learn – almost no economists or politicians actually believe that.
Allegedly there are no atheists in a foxhole, and history tells us that everyone becomes a Keynesian when they are tasked with avoiding a recession.
Just as borrowing money to buy a house or get a uni degree makes sense because the future benefits are greater than the interest costs, borrowing money to avoid a recession and save tens of thousands of jobs can set Australia up for decades. It’s a pity it takes a pandemic to drive such honesty into our public debate, but we should take advantage of the honesty nonetheless.
Whether it’s pumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy via Kevin Rudd’s $950 cheques to nearly everyone or through Scott Morrison’s $750 cheques to the unemployed and age pensioners, boosting benefits is a highly effective way to keep money going through cash registers, and in turn, keep people in their jobs. Think of the “cash splash” element of economic stimulus as buying a lower rate of unemployment. Virtually all economists think it’s a bargain.
But the stimulus will need to be much bigger and last much longer than one-off cheques. That’s why the government should increase weekly payments for more Australians, and think about all of the projects we can start building today that will serve us well into the future.
Just as a lot of people being stuck at home will bring forward some household painting, gardening and minor repairs, so too should governments use “idle time” and record low interest rates to bring forward housing, energy and transport projects. We don’t need to choose between a cash splash or big long run projects. The economy needs both, now.
But more importantly, the economic victims of Covid-19 – just like the health victims in intensive care – need help, now. Offering to help later is the same as not offering to help at all.

Whether it’s pumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy via Kevin Rudd’s $950 cheques to nearly everyone or through Scott Morrison’s $750 cheques to the unemployed and age pensioners, boosting benefits is a highly effective way to keep money going through cash registers, and in turn, keep people in their jobs. Think of the “cash splash” element of economic stimulus as buying a lower rate of unemployment. Virtually all economists think it’s a bargain.
But the stimulus will need to be much bigger and last much longer than one-off cheques. That’s why the government should increase weekly payments for more Australians, and think about all of the projects we can start building today that will serve us well into the future.
Just as a lot of people being stuck at home will bring forward some household painting, gardening and minor repairs, so too should governments use “idle time” and record low interest rates to bring forward housing, energy and transport projects. We don’t need to choose between a cash splash or big long run projects. The economy needs both, now.
But more importantly, the economic victims of Covid-19 – just like the health victims in intensive care – need help, now. Offering to help later is the same as not offering to help at all.

Australia's coronavirus self-isolation rules: who has to do it and how it works
","Claire Capel-Stanley and 
Calla Wahlquist","With new requirements for everyone entering the country coming into force, here’s what it actually means to self-isolate

From midnight on Sunday 15 March, everyone entering Australia from overseas, except for flight attendants and residents of the Pacific Islands, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Failing to do so risks thousands in fines.
But what does self-isolation actually mean, and can you still Uber home from the airport? We answered your burning questions.
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, indicated that people subject to self-isolation would still be able to take taxis and public transport from airports.
People who need to travel domestically after arriving in Australia will be able to continue their journey, beginning self-isolate when they arrive at their destination, according to Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton.
It’s important to maintain hygiene measures while in transit. Use hand sanitiser and cough into your elbow or into a tissue, and maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other passengers where possible. If you are a recently returned traveller in New South Wales, you must wear a surgical mask while travelling to your home or hotel.
The safest way to get home from the airport is for someone you live with to pick you up. If you have to take an Uber or a taxi, it’s worth sitting in the back seat and keeping a note of the vehicle number or the driver.
Taxi and Uber drivers should be taking extra precautions too, said Chris Moy, the South Australian president of the Australian Medical Association. He recommends drivers use hand sanitiser and disinfectant.
Travellers from the Pacific Islands are who are transiting through Australia are currently exempt from the 14-day self-isolation requirement in both Australia and New Zealand.
This exemption is explicitly mentioned in the Victorian state of emergency declaration.
That is because many Pacific Island nations are only accessible via Australia and New Zealand. There have also been very few cases of Covid-19 in the Pacific.
This depends. If you have been diagnosed with Covid-19, anyone you live with will be classed as a close contact so all of you will need to self-isolate.
If you are only self-isolating as a precaution, for example because you have just returned from overseas, they do not need to self-isolate – but you should stay as far away from them as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible. Ensure everyone in the home washes their hands frequently, and surfaces and doorknobs are frequently wiped with an alcohol-based disinfectant. Try to stay at least 1.5 metres away from the other people in your home. You cannot have visitors.
It’s recommended you stay away from people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus, including elderly relatives, and minimise contact with other people, including children. If you are experiencing symptoms, wear a mask or a makeshift mask.
Moy said that people needing to look after children or parents while in self-isolation should maintain good hygiene practices and minimise contact. Try to keep a 1.5-metre distance when possible, wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, and disinfect surfaces.
“To expect hard and fast rules is difficult,” he said. “We’re asking for patience, commonsense and probably a level of ingenuity from the public to get us through this.”
Each state and territory has slightly different laws around self-isolating, but if you are under a mandatory order to self-isolate it’s best to avoid going outside for anything but medical appointments and emergencies. Wear a mask when outside.
The Australian government’s health advice recommends exercise DVDs or walking around your backyard.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from Australian National University, says the thing to keep in mind is your proximity to other people – which means a walk alone, at a quiet time of day, should be fine.
The situation may be different if you are under a legislative order, in which case you will have to abide by the rules set down in each state.
If you are self-isolating because you have returned from overseas or have had contact with a known case, and you begin to notice respiratory symptoms (particularly fever, shortness of breath or a cough), contact your state or territory health department, your GP or the emergency clinic of your local hospital. Call before attending your GP or hospital to warn them you may have the virus.
If you have severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, call triple zero.
You will not be able to get a test unless you fit certain high-risk criteria and have respiratory symptoms. The Australian government is not testing asymptomatic people and at this stage testing remains restricted to people returning from overseas and known contacts of confirmed cases. If you have symptoms of pneumonia you will be tested regardless of travel or contact history.
Ask a neighbour, family member or friend to deliver groceries to you. These should be left outside your door. The same goes for grocery deliveries and takeaway food.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said government care packages will be made available to people in that state . “In the event, through no fault of your own, you’ve found yourself at home without the basics, we will get those basics to you,” he said.
Some community groups are also organising to provide food and supplies to people in isolation. If you have a neighbourhood Facebook group, check with them.
People who arrived in Australia before the mandatory 14-day self-isolation began at 12.01am on 16 March are not legally required to self-isolate, but they should still exercise caution.
The incubation period for Covid-19 is between five and 10 days. That means if you returned from overseas in the past two weeks, particularly from countries with a high rate of spread, such as the US, you should be engaging in social distancing, and monitoring yourself for any symptoms.
Collignon says the higher your risk of experiencing complications from the virus, the more distancing and hygiene measures you should be putting in place.
“For people in the high-risk group, particularly people over 70, once we get a lot of transmission in society, relative self-isolation is a good idea,” he said.
“You don’t become a hermit, but you limit your contact to people who are well, and to fewer people.”
The rate at which people should be increasing their isolation should rise with the spread of the disease, Collignon says. So while a healthy 50-year-old person may be social distancing now, once the weather cools in winter and the spread of the virus increases throughout the community, they may need to self-isolate.
Self-isolation for 14 days is mandatory for anyone who arrived in Australia after 12.01am, 16 March and financial penalties apply.

","For some, workplaces are hotspots. For the over-65s, it’s shops and restaurants. We urgently need to change our behaviour
Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.
Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for diseases like Sars, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness – it is easy to recognise people who are infected.
In the case of Covid-19, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why airport screening at arrival is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, containment has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.
So how does an epidemic spread through a population – and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as R), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.
The larger the value of R, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to 1.4 new infections. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the early stages of an outbreak. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.
In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce R below 1. For diseases such as measles, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on R. For R of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for R of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get R below 1.
However, an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.
Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.
Another option to reduce the duration of infection is continued testing; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).
If we can’t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds with hot water and soap, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick – all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.
Cancelling large gatherings, working from home and school closures are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.
But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called BBC Pandemic, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.
What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 – who are particularly at risk from severe Covid-19 illness – make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.
Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number R, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.
We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it. Starting now, and for the duration of this epidemic, we all have a role to play and a responsibility to modify our behaviour in order to protect the ones who are most at risk.

Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).
If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.
However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.
All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.
Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.
The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.
Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But this week, a WHO expert suggested that this has not been the case with Covid-19. Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said the evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.
Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.
For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.
Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.’"

What effect will winter have on coronavirus in Australia?

Graham Readfearn","As the southern hemisphere winter looms, cooler temperatures may affect the behaviour of the virus – and of people, who tend to spend more time close together indoors


Tue 17 Mar 2020 03.12 GMT

In many parts of the world, wintertime tends to be when people get sick from viruses that cause colds and influenza.
The illness Covid-19 broke out in China’s winter and spread in Iran, Italy and the rest of Europe as those countries endured their coldest months.
As Australia heads into winter, what could this mean for the spread of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes the Covid-19 illness?
Experts have told Guardian Australia that cooler temperatures can affect the behaviour and spread of a virus in three interconnected ways.
Firstly, temperatures can affect the virus directly.
Some viruses may have a temperature range where they can survive for longer and this is partly dependent on their “envelope” – the outer layer that’s made of lipids (which is why washing hands with soap is effective, because it disrupts the lipids).
Secondly, when temperatures drop, this changes the behaviour of the human population. People tend to spend more time indoors and in closer contact, making it easier for the virus to spread.
Thirdly, we already know that like in other parts of the world, winter in Australia is when other viruses circulate and this can affect the immunity of populations.
Associate Prof Tom Kotsimbos of Monash University, who is also a respiratory physician at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, says seasonality can cause an increase in the spread of viruses.
“That is well established, but whether we understand that deeply is another thing. It does have an influence, but we don’t understand it specifically. This is a new virus, and that does not mean it will be like the others.
“We know it’s about the biology of the virus, the general and specific immunity of us and the environmental and behavioural conditions,” he says.
But there is much less certainty, he says, about how important each factor is when it comes if a person gets sick.
“It’s interesting that [Covid-19] has spread all over the world quite quickly – both north and south,” he said, adding that this suggested either the new virus was not dependent on temperature or that this dependency was not as important as the lack of immunity in the population that was helping it to spread.
Some studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed have tried to find out if there is a clear link between temperature and the rate of infection of the coronavirus, but have been inconclusive or contradictory.
Dr Meru Sheel of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at Australian National University, says: “There is no clear evidence to suggest a relationship between outdoor temperatures and spread of coronaviruses.
“We don’t know enough about Sars-CoV-2 yet to know how change in weather will affect outbreak and the disease epidemiology.
“In some tropical countries such as Pacific Island countries, despite the warm weather, there is some seasonal influenza activity and it is related to increase in travellers from countries such as Australia and New Zealand and to a much lesser extent related to change in weather.”
Sheel said studies are under way investigating the duration of the survival of Sars-CoV-2 under different conditions and on different surfaces.
“Evidence from these studies is likely to improve our understanding of the disease transmission pathways and improve our response strategy.
“However until we know more, we need to ensure that all surfaces are decontaminated using disinfectants such as ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, bleach etc – based on local infection, prevention and control guidelines.”
Sheel pointed to a review of research into other known human coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers, that found the viruses survived for varying lengths of time.
The study found they could be infectious on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, metal, wood and paper for up to nine days, but disinfectant cleaning was effective.
Sheel says rather than the temperature itself, the change in the way Covid-19 spreads “is likely influenced by frequency at which people interact during cooler versus warmer weather”.
Dr Chris Burrell, emeritus professor of virology of the University of Adelaide, said there were other known coronaviruses that had been around for half a century and these were also prevalent in winter.
“But that’s because of people congregating together,” he said.
He said one example of this effect was with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that causes a common respiratory disease in young children that tends to arrive in winter.
Burrell says: “If you think of children in preschool, in the summer they’re out in the sun and don’t have a lot of personal contact with each other. In winter, they’re inside and breathing the same air.
“I think that any effect of temperature on coronavirus won’t be nearly as important as the effect of limiting its spread by isolating people.”
Ten years ago Tom Kotsimbos led a taskforce of respiratory specialists that looked at what impact a potential early winter arrival of swine flu could have on Australia’s population.
He said the same questions that were being asked then – about the influence of temperature and the overlap with Australia’s flu season – are being asked again now.
“Clearly this is a different virus – but we have been here before ... but we don’t know how Covid-19 will behave.
“On an individual level, if you get a virus when your defences are already down from a recent viral infection, then that could be increasingly challenging with the progression of the disease.
“Previous studies have suggested that if you have recently recovered from a viral infection then your innate immune systems may actually be bolstered and that might help with subsequent attacks.”
He said adding the impacts of Covid-19 on top of flu season “will put an incredible stress on the healthcare system”.
Dr Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said: “My concern is that [in winter] people tend to be in closer contact and it coincides with our flu season.
“My main concern is that when you think of the healthcare system, that does get pushed in a bad flu season. If we combine a moderate flu season with a moderate coronavirus season, that could be problematic.”
Sheel said: “As Australia moves into cooler weather, we are likely to see an increase in respiratory diseases such as common colds, influenza and RSV infections.
“To minimise the pressure on the health system it will be important for the community to adopt public health prevention measures, get vaccinated and staying at home when unwell – practising social distancing.
“This will also help improve our ability to test for Covid-19 and in return protect our vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions and minimise their risk of exposure to infection with Covid-19. All these factors will contribute towards better control of the outbreak.”"

Joe Biden sweeps key primaries and moves closer to nomination

Lauren Gambino in Washington
Joe Biden swept three key primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, dominating a third consecutive week of elections as he built a nearly indomitable lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.
His resounding victories all but eliminated a path for his rival, Bernie Sanders, whose campaign is at a crossroads as he contemplates whether to stay in a fight for the liberal agenda he’s championed for decades, or to exit and help Democrats unify the party behind his opponent as the country faces a public health crisis.
“Our campaign has had a very good night – and is a little closer to securing the Democratic party’s nomination for president,” Biden said on Tuesday in a speech live-streamed from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after he was declared the winner of Florida and Illinois.
It came as Donald Trump formally sealed the Republican presidential nomination, surpassing the necessary delegate threshold after facing no significant opposition.
Tuesday’s elections underscored the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic presidential primary amid a global outbreak that has closed borders, roiled the economy and touched nearly every corner of public life. Ohio, which was also due to vote on Tuesday, postponed its elections, defying a court order and closing polls, even as Florida, Illinois and Arizona moved forward in spite of pressure to delay their contests.
Before polls closed on Tuesday, Sanders delivered an address responding to the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. He predicted the US government would ultimately spend $2tn “to prevent deaths, job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe” and called for every American household to receive monthly payments of $2,000 during the crisis.
“Our country and our world are facing an unprecedented series of crises,” he said in remarks that made no reference to the election.
More than 6,300 Americans have tested positive for the virus, despite limited testing, with 108 deaths as of Tuesday evening. The message from officials is that the outbreak will worsen dramatically.
On Monday, Trump advised Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10, further restricting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held for the next eight weeks.
Against that backdrop, Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, announced on Monday afternoon that he would seek to postpone the election until 2 June. Hours later an Ohio county judge rejected the request, saying it would set a “terrible” precedent.
DeWine instructed the state’s director of health to declare a public health emergency. He argued that holding the election would place voters and poll workers in potential danger.
“We should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens,” DeWine said at a press conference, adding: “I think when we look back on this, we are going to be glad we did this.”
Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assailed the move for causing “more chaos and confusion” and sought to discourage other states from following suit.
But it may be too late. Louisiana and Georgia were the first states to announce they would delay their primaries in response to the outbreak. Kentucky joined Ohio on Monday, choosing to delay its primary from 19 May to 23 June. And on Tuesday, Maryland became the fifth state to postpone its presidential primary election, moving it from 28 April to 2 June.
Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois took additional precautions to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers, including sanitizing voting machines and offering curbside voting. But there were reports of poll worker shortages and confusion over polling locations.
The virus has reshaped the 2020 election campaign in other ways. Trump is not holding his signature rallies and the Democratic candidates, both in their late 70s, are forgoing big gatherings, opting instead to hold virtual town halls and live-streamed events. On the eve of the latest primaries, Sanders participated in a digital rally from his hometown of Burlington, while Biden held a “tele-town hall”.
The election delays have added another layer of unpredictability to a primary that has seen months of twists and surprises. Simon Rosenberg, a veteran consultant and the president of the New Democrat Network and the New Policy Institute, said coronavirus presented an “unprecedented” challenge for the party.
“Democrats now must to find a way to complete this primary given the uncertainty of when each state is going to vote and whether we’re even going to be able to have a convention in July,” he said.
In recent weeks, exit polls found that voters trust Biden more to handle a major crisis. He entered Tuesday with a lead of more than 150 delegates. But Sanders, the frontrunner after the Nevada caucuses in February, faced a narrow path to the nomination that would have required him to greatly outperform expectations in states he lost in 2016.
If I lose this thing, Joe wins – Joe, I will be there for you
Padding his delegate lead further, Biden was also finally declared the winner of last week’s primary in Washington, a state Sanders hoped to win.
Lifted by a hasty alignment of the party’s establishment, Biden has built a coalition on the strength of his support from African Americans and older voters. But Sanders continues to dominate with young voters, a constituency the former vice-president will need in the general election.
In his remarks on Tuesday night, Biden made an explicit appeal to Sanders’ loyal supporters.
“I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do,” he said. “Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate, is to unify this party and unify this nation.
“Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said, before running through a list of issues Sanders and his supporters have championed, including healthcare, income inequality and the climate crisis.
“Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,” Biden said. “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.”

The peak Aboriginal medical service of the Northern Territory says it wrote to the federal minister Ken Wyatt six days ago asking for work-for-the-dole activities to be suspended “on public health grounds” to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission in vulnerable remote communities, but did not receive a response.
“We are disappointed that the minister has not responded to our letter,” said the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory chief executive, John Paterson.
But on Monday Wyatt’s department, the National Indigenous Australians Agency wrote to providers to say “mutual obligations remain in place at this stage”, meaning that Aboriginal people will still be expected to turn up for group activities or risk losing their welfare payments.
“Any changes for particular areas affected by coronavirus or other extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis in line with existing procedures,” the NIAA chief executive, Ray Griggs, wrote in a letter obtained by Guardian Australia.
The letter said any community development program participant who was unwell and may have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 should call Centrelink to discuss obtaining a “major personal crisis exemption”, valid for 14 days, to “avoid any suspension of payment”.
But Amsant said that advice “raises public health concerns” and increases unnecessary risks.
“Preventing and slowing the spread of the virus must be our overwhelming priority,” Paterson said. “The stakes could not be higher.
“We have a narrow window of opportunity to prevent the spread of the virus into our communities. As the funder and contract managers of these non-essential programs, the Australian government must exercise its duty of care.”
Labor and the Greens have also called for a suspension of work for the dole and mutual obligation commitments.
“It’s time for the government to put the health of remote communities first and suspend mutual obligation requirements,” said Labor’s Indigenous Australians spokesperson, Linda Burney.
“At a time when travel to remote communities in the NT is being restricted it is completely inconsistent to force people to participate in group activities.”
“This isn’t just about people who are ill or required to self-isolate,” she said. “It’s about limiting risk for the whole community, including those who are sick and older.”
On Tuesday the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said “CDP activities play an important role in community life” and mutual obligations would stay in place for the time being.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

“Any changes for particular areas affected by coronavirus or other extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis,” a spokesman for the minister said.
This applied to all Australians who have mutual obligation requirements and was in line with health department advice, the minister’s office said.
But the Central Land Council said exemptions on a case-by-case basis would not work.
“Health services will be stretched to the limit and should not be burdened with having to issue medical certificates for individual CDP participants,” said its chief executive Joe Martin-Jard.
“The sensible and responsible thing to do is to cancel all participation requirements for the duration of the pandemic and allow our people to put their health and safety first.”
The Greens senator Rachel Siewert echoed calls for suspension, and said people might make decisions that endanger their health or others out of fear of losing their payments. “Our first priority should be looking after people’s health and, as we surely move towards more people needing to isolate and socially distance, will this government still expect those on income support to be attending meetings and appointments?” Siewert asked.
Amsant said the risk factors for Covid-19 were greater than the H1N1 virus in 2009, which resulted in death rates among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population six times higher than the non-Indigenous community.
“We need a clear, consistent and appropriate response that will best support individuals and communities and contribute to the efforts of government and community organisations to deal with this crisis.”"

Amanda Holpuch in New York","Experts cast doubt on officials’ assertion in country that has 1,400-mile border with China 


Tue 17 Mar 2020 23.14 GMT


First published on Tue 17 Mar 2020 22.26 GMT


The porous Myanmar-China border stretches more than 1,400 miles but coronavirus cases have only been reported on one side.
In China, more than 80,800 people have been infected, but according to Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s civilian leader, the country has not yet seen a single confirmed case.
“Until now, no one in our country is infected with Covid-19,” said the country’s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in a televised address on Monday.
To the country’s west, 114 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in India and five in Bangladesh. Myanmar’s southern neighbour, Thailand, has reported 114 cases.
Attempting to explain the anomaly, a spokesperson for Myanmar’s government has claimed that people’s “lifestyle and diet” protected them from the disease – stoking concerns the country is downplaying the impact of the respiratory illness.
Zaw Htay, a government spokesperson, also said the common use of cash instead of credit cards, helped curb the spread of the illness. There is no evidence to show that diet or banknotes can stop the spread of coronavirus.
“Such irresponsible statements clash with everything known about the coronavirus outbreak, defy reality, and only serve to give a false sense of security to the country’s people about the disease and their risks of infection,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch, in a blog post.
Ten patients in Myanmar are currently in quarantine awaiting test results, according to the government.
Globally, there are more than 161,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in 150 countries or territories. The World Health Organization said the global threat from the respiratory illness is high.
“The government’s public lack of concern has sparked rumours and speculation about the government’s response, leaving many distrustful and unable to make informed decisions for their families,” Robertson said.
Aung Aung, a surgeon at Mandalay general hospital in Myanmar, told the New York Times: “I don’t think Myanmar has the modern techniques to know whether the virus is here.”
Facing questions from reporters, Zaw Htay acknowledged scepticism about the government’s claim there are no coronavirus cases in the country, but insisted it was accurate.
Even without any reported cases, the government has banned festivals and entertainment events in April, including the Thingyan festival, the biggest annual holiday in the country.
The government has also started a fund to raise money from the public to support its response to the illness.
“I urge those of you who would like to donate to give as much as you can,” said Aung San Suu Kyi."

What’s quarantine without a fun way to pass the time? As pandemic-induced social distancing pushes more and more people to the solitude of the home, self-isolators have started coming up with ways to entertain themselves, their neighbours and strangers around the world through social media.
For cinemagoers who miss the collective experience of the silver screen – the phones bleeping in quiet scenes, that guy behind you munching popcorn in your ear and, perhaps more particularly, the delight of dissecting the film with friends afterwards – the UK actor Brett Goldstein has started up a film club on Twitter.
Under the hashtag #IsolationFilmClub, a movie is selected every day by a nominated user, “anyone who wants to watch it can, and then talk about it using the hashtag”, Goldstein said.
Since lots of people will be stuck at home, I’ve decided to start a film club. Every day we pick a film. Anyone who wants to watch it can, and then talk about it using the hashtag #isolationfilmclub First film is Long Shot.I nominate @MrNishKumar to choose tomorrow’s. pic.twitter.com/IdSosVibhq
For those who want something a bit more active, there’s Big Kitchen Disco: a collaborative playlist coupled with a simultaneously solo household kitchen boogie, which kicked off with – naturally – Dancing On My Own by Robyn.
It’s Mardi Gras meets the Italian balcony musicians.
OK so the idea is this. We can't go out, so let's all meet at 7pm in YOUR kitchen and have a dance. Send your suggestions and we'll pick one for each night, and add it to the Big Kitchen Disco playlist https://t.co/5Vwv0qhc0T
Or you could dance along to one of the many quarantine playlists being created. The actor Rita Wilson – who was diagnosed with coronavirus along with her husband Tom Hanks on Australia’s Gold Coast last week – collaborated with the public to produce Quarantunes, a 47-song set on Spotify including such classics as Locked Up by Akon, U Can’t Touch This by MC Hammer and I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.
And since you’re dancing, why not couple it with a light show? After Sydney, Australia announced it was cancelling its annual aural and visual festival Vivid – known not just for the colourful light-art displays over landmarks throughout the CBD, but its live concert series – a DIY version has sprung up on Facebook.
“Get your own festive lights out on your balcony, switch over your lounge room bulbs to COLOUR. Get your self isolation pad LIT for our own makeshift DIY Vivid Australia,” the event page says.
Meanwhile over on Instagram, Australian musicians who are part of youth broadcaster Triple J’s emerging music program, Unearthed, have been covering each other’s songs.
Hauskey, the musician who started it, said he started doing it to stave off the feeling of being “useless” while stuck at home. With so many musicians having had gigs cancelled for the foreseeable future, “exposing my small audience to someone else’s music is one tiny way I can help out”, he said.
 It feels *very* odd to promote yourself right now, but the music industry needs a lot of support so maybe it would be cool if local artists promoted other local artists? Here’s @elueramusic’s ‘Good Girl’ with my own little spin. Go stream it! #covered19

For those whose cathartic impulses tend towards the introspective, the Oregon illustrator Carson Ellis has started a Quarantine Art Club on Instagram, posting regular art prompts, challenges and tips in an attempt to help others entertain themselves or the other people in their household – particularly the youngsters.
 WOW. How are you all doing? Today was my kid’s seventh birthday. We were supposed to have a party but that became a dinner at a restaurant which became a dinner at home with a single friend which, in the end, became TOTAL LOCKDOWN when we made the call to isolate completely at home for the next week without friends or playdates. Each time we cancelled the birthday plan and replaced it with something more restrictive and lonely, he fell apart. But then, each time, he collected himself and moved on. He’s a ray of light and fortitude. I’m so lucky to be his mom. I hope all you other Americans are staying home this week as much as you possibly can. By all accounts, this moment is critical. If we’re going to flatten that curve, we need to do it this week and we need to do it by staying away from each other. Please, please, stay home if you have the privilege to do it. Some of us have to go to work. Some of us have to help those in need. But a lot of us can stay in and deprive this virus of more human fodder and it’s our duty to do it. Meanwhile, I’m thinking of ways that we can stay connected here through art. I’ll keep posting drawing prompts on Tuesdays but I’d like to post art assignments more often than that because we’re all going to be more isolated than usual. Many of us just became unwitting homeschool teachers to our kids. Many of us will be home all alone for a while. Let’s keep busy. I’ll try to post assignments every day this week that you can do on your own or with your family. Let me know if you have drawing exercises you love and I’ll share them. Okay! Watch this spot for the first assignment on Monday and stay safe. Check in with your neighbors and wash your hands. ❤️

More than 700 people responded to the first challenge: a self-portrait.
Ellis’s Quarantine Art Club is a more organised, visual art-focused version of the creative projects happening around the world under the hashtag #IsolationCreation, in which art-makers of all kinds are using the enforced downtime to make, bake, carve, collage and concoct their way through the crisis.

Silver linings: how to stay positive during the coronavirus crisis

These stories are designed to offer practical advice, provide some entertainment, foster a sense of social cohesion, and remind people of the good in the world during these strange and isolating times.
With all the tragic things that are happening in the world as a result of the coronavirus, now might seem like an unusual time to talk about being positive. Yet staying positive is a core ingredient in the recipe of successful coping in a crisis.
Now, more than ever, is the time for us to be proactive about creating small moments of happiness in our days, given the findings in psychology research that positive emotions help us to undo the negative effects of stress.
I’ll come to the research in a minute, but first there are a few really practical things you can do to foster positive emotions.
Savour the small moments: Even during lockdown you still have many small moments to savour. The smell of coffee, the feel of the warm shower on your back and so on. When you stop to take in these moments, rather then let them rush by on automatic pilot, you are giving your brain a chance to process the pleasure, which boosts your serotonin – the feel good neurotransmitter that helps elevate your mood and make you feel calm.
Strengthen your connections: for those of us in family lockdown, now is the opportunity to spend quality time with our loved ones. Take the time to hug your kids or partner, look them in the eyes, have long conversations with them – all of these gestures promote closeness and also boost your oxytocin, which is a hormone that bonds people and also has a calming effect on your body. When your oxytocin levels spike they tell your body to switch off cortisol, the stress hormone.
Look for the good in others: These types of crises can bring out both the worst and the best in human nature. This week there were two Youtube clips that went viral in Australia about toilet paper. One was of three grown women fighting in Woolworths over a packet of toilet paper. The other was two young children dragging a large cart of toilet paper behind them and stopping at the homes of elderly people in their neighbourhood to give them a roll. I like to think that the best in human nature is rising to the coronavirus challenge. Philanthropists are donating money to scientists to find a cure. Doctors and medical staff are working overtime to help sick patients. Neighbourhoods are putting together care packages for people who are sleeping rough. People are posting positive messages on social media. Friends from across the globe reaching out to each other. When we tune into these positive and pro-social aspects of the crisis, we are united in hope.
By tuning into these three silver linings, you can potentially change your brain chemistry and build up your energy stores to help you cope with the other aspects of your day that have been made more difficult.
Taking charge of our mental health and capturing the small moments will help as we go further into the unknown, too. If we can foster positive emotions, the flow-on effects are well researched, and well documented. In fact, positive emotions are a key resource for us during the coronavirus crisis because they can do a number of things:
Increase your resilience: Research has shown that when we experience positive emotions on the back of a stressful event, we bounce back more quickly and have a faster “cardiovascular recovery” time – our heart rate lowers and our blood pressure stabilises more quickly when we are able to be positive.
Increase your immunity: a study where people were deliberately infected with the influenza virus and rhinovirus found that those people who had more positive emotions were more likely to fight off the symptoms. People low on positive emotions were 2.9 times more likely to contract a respiratory illness in this study.
Make you think more clearly: the way we feel influences the way we think. Positive emotions boost our problem solving abilities as well as our judgment, decision-making, cognitive flexibility and creativity. Staying positive will help you and your kids to be better at solving all the little problems that are being thrown our way right now, such as figuring out new technology platforms for working (and schooling) from home.
Every dark cloud has a silver lining and this is your chance to thicken that lining and take charge of your mental health so that you come out of this experience stronger.

The BBC World Service’s 13 Minutes to the Moon is guaranteed to take you to a different time and place from where we’re at right now. And it’s also a reminder of what a determined community inspired by a great leader can do. There were 13 minutes from when the Apollo 11 lunar lander detached from the mother ship to when it landed on the moon’s surface. The podcast takes you through, in detail, those 13 minutes, with original audio, new interviews and archived interviews from many of those who were there. There’s original music, too, from the great Hans Zimmer – and even a bonus episode all about the music.
Start from the beginning! The second series that looks at the doomed Apollo 13 mission is just out. – Graham Readfearn, environment reporter
Was it an urban myth or was it real? Generations of journalists heard the story from rickshaw drivers, fixers, tea-sellers. The story was that in the forest in the city limits of Delhi, cut off from the world, lived a prince, a princess and a queen. They were said to be the last of a distinguished Shia Muslim royal line. Before moving to the crumbling forest palace, they had taken up residence in the first-class waiting room of the Delhi railway station. While in exile at the station, they demanded that their lineage be recognised.
Ellen Barry, a New York Times journalist, unpicks this wild and at times unsettling story with great care and sensitivity in the three-part series for the Daily, The Jungle Prince of Delhi. It sounds like folklore but by episode three it becomes deeply political. In the end it’s a story of family, homeland, dislocation, trauma and the damage done by Partition. And at its conclusion, it had me weeping. – Brigid Delaney, columnist
This is the story of coworking juggernaut WeWork and its cult-like founder and former CEO, Adam Neumann, who took the company from living room start-up to blockbuster valued at $47bn – before hubris sent it into a massive nosedive. This six-part series is a truly fascinating insight into the charlatans and grifters of the business world, from “disruptor” disciples to “unicorn” hunters, and the way it all thrives on hot air. As with all good tales of downfall, the best place to start is the beginning. – Stephanie Convery, deputy culture editor
Its host Molly Fischer has now left the show, but while she was at the helm, The Cut on Tuesdays provided 48 bingeable episodes of well-reported, feminist, funny discussion from topics ranging from the very heavy (what it’s like to be a woman in a migrant caravan) to the light and effervescent (what it means to be horny in 2019). This show listens like a conversation between your smartest girlfriends, who just so happen to be very good journalists. It sounded like everything female-focused media should be, but often isn’t. Start with the episode about pubic hair for a chat that’s often had in private, made public, or Welcome to my Bad Dinner Party, for a cooking challenge with a difference, made even tastier by the wisdom of Samin Nosrat. – Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor
Molly is diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, leaves her unhappy marriage of 15 years and embarks on a series of sexual adventures – then sits down in a studio and tells her best friend Nikki all about it.
Start from episode one, but episode two is when you’ll be clutching your sides laughing and/or dying of embarrassment. It’s a great reflection on what it means to feel alive, even when death is just around the corner. – Ellen Leabeater, audio producer

Adrienne Matei","With millions of us lying low to limit the spread of Covid-19, how best to manage being cooped up for days on end?


Tue 17 Mar 2020 14.07 GMT

By now, we all know that voluntary social distancing is key to mitigating the spread of Covid-19. In the grand scheme of things, lying low for a little while is a small sacrifice to make for the increased safety of all, though it certainly will pose challenges, not least of which being to our relationships.
“It will become easy to think of one another as a burden,” writes the Atlantic’s Helena Fitzgerald, “especially when we are cooped up together or when isolation breeds feelings of abandonment.” This raises the question: how can we best manage the unusual social circumstances we’re in?
In 2017, engineer Ansley Barnard spent eight months living in an isolated dome habitat with five other scientists as part of Nasa’s Hi-SEAS program, which was developed to simulate the experience of traveling to Mars. During that time, she learned several lessons applicable to anyone living with roommates.
“Talking about a potential conflict early on prevents things from getting worse,” says Barnard. “Our strategies in the habitat were to be open about our feelings and avoid blame. It can help to carve out private places in the same home so that you can decompress alone if you need to,” she says.
Barnard and her team ate dinner together every evening, using that time to set aside any issues and work on their relationships with each other. “I think having a positive attitude and looking at your situation as a temporary opportunity instead of a setback can help keep you moving forward,” she says.
According to Joshua David Stein, editor of the parenting publication Fatherly, if you’re practicing social distancing with your kids, now is the time to readjust your rule structure.
“Just like how when you take kids on a plane they can watch as much TV as they want – it’s kind of the same, at least for now,” he says. Fatherly has compiled a list of at-home activities for bored kids, the internet abounds with kid-friendly podcasts, museum tours and educational videos, and Stein notes that it’s a good time to get outside and take advantage of local parks, too.
If your kids are worried about grandparents they’re unable to visit during the pandemic, Stein suggests: “without lying, frame it in a way that will assuage their worries as much as possible. Like, ‘Grandma is doing fine, for her safety and our safety, we’re going to rely on FaceTime for now.’” It’s also to be expected that your patience will wear thin at times. “You’re going to freak out at your kids a little bit,” says Stein. “It’s not the best thing in the world but it’s not the end of the world, don’t beat yourself up about it, try to do better next time.”
“This is a situation where you kind of know what is going to happen so you have time to come up with a gameplan,” says Erin Davidson, a couples and sex therapist. “Chat about what to do in moments where things are stressful – normalize that it’s OK if you get on each other’s nerves, and decide on a signal that means ‘OK, we need to take a moment in separate rooms, or recognize better communication is needed, or perhaps someone needs a hug or to talk about emotions that are coming up.’”
Davidson says both partners should get comfortable asking for – and giving each other – space. While it may be a tricky time to date, low-risk, symptom-free partners living in relative isolation together can certainly use this time to have more sex. “There’s a website called MojoUpgrade.com and it’s fun because both of you fill out ‘yes-no-maybe’ questions about sexual things you want to try individually, and then it only emails you with the things you both matched up with a ‘yes’ on,” she says. “It’s a low-pressure fun thing you can do.”
For the last three years, writer and musician Kristal Jax has been making ironic, Barbie-heavy memes about coping with mental illness, trauma and social issues, which she posts to her Instagram account @Dyingbutfine. Several of Jax’s recent posts have centered on Covid-19, including a “quarantine bingo” meme and a multi-post filled with ideas for how to distract yourself while home alone, such as by crafting, cleaning or making your own memes. “I find humour is a way to connect and let off steam when you’re really upset or anxious – just have some kind of catharsis,” she says.
In addition to taking on domestic projects, Jax says reaching out to offer support to others, if you’re able, is a good way to feel less alone. “I find helping people during times of crisis really helps you control your own anxiety, because you’re like, ‘Oh, I have a purpose,’” she says. “If you don’t know someone well enough to know how they would feel about you checking in on them you could still send a message to them saying, ‘Hey, I’m checking in on friends right now, do you need anything?’” And if you’re completely cooped up, “know that you staying home is you doing something,” says Jax, “even if you feel powerless.”"

I have a job in China and left just before the coronavirus outbreak to visit my parents in the US. My wife, a Chinese citizen, wants me to return to meet her at our  apartment in a major Chinese city not far from the first afflicted province of Hubei, so that we can weather the crisis together. She believes that our life shouldn’t be put on hold for weeks or months, and that our different experiences of the outbreak might be pushing us apart. I’m eager to get back to her as soon as possible but worried that my travelling will endanger us both, not to mention cause  anxiety to my dad who is already struggling with serious health issues. On top of this, my government has advised strongly against travel to China and my boss has offered me a way to do my work online. How can I find a path towards making the right decision for myself, my wife and our marriage?
Did you see those huge lines at airports this week, hundreds of passengers crammed shoulder to shoulder so that customs halls around the world looked like livestock pens? Like you, I’d thought about being in those lines. I had thought that I needed to fly home to my parents and my grandparents while I still could, and that if anything happened to them while I was away I could never live with myself. Then I remembered that to pass through an airport right now is to endanger someone else’s loved one. This thing moves so fast, and tests have been so slow, that we simply do not know what each of us is carrying. Patient 31 in South Korea went to church twice and infected 1,000 people.
Once you grasp that moving around right now imposes risk on others, there’s no question left about whether it’s fair to do it, even so we can get back to our people. It’s not. Don’t travel unless you absolutely have to.
I know I’m asking a lot of you here. You asked how to make the best decision for yourself, your wife and your marriage, and instead I’m asking you to make this decision for people you’ve never met.
Your wife might be angry if you tell her you’re putting strangers over what she wants, and normally I’d think she was right. But we have to start caring about strangers, richly caring – caring in the way that makes us prepared to put their wellbeing before our own. What will unite us right now, and God knows we could use it, is finally seeing each other as worth making sacrifices for.
I am confident that patient 31 felt just like you and me: scared, lonely and wanting the joy and reassurance of a familiar group of people. Now thousands more are in danger who didn’t need to be.
It’s hard to realise while we’re in their grip but thoughts like “this will be really hard” and “I want to be around my people” don’t make us special exemptions from the collective, they throw us right in the thick of it.
There’s something galvanising about that; we can keep each other mentally in our pockets as we do the hard, boring, lonely things we will have to in the coming months. Somewhere I’ll wash my hands for you, while you stay home for me. I’ll think of your grandmother while I’m freezing a batch of soup and you think of mine while you bounce a tennis ball off the wall.
It’s a dusty adage (the best ones often are) that we reveal ourselves when we’re tested. Let the part of you that this crisis illuminates be a part that you’re proud of – one that takes other people as seriously as you hope to be taken.

How not to panic during the coronavirus pandemic: welcome hard times like a Stoic
",Contact author,"We might all be quarantined for a while. There are worse uses of your time than reading the Stoics

People around the world are feeling rudderless and adrift. There’s conflicting information about the pandemic – but it’s not just about health. People losing work, feeling frightened, being isolated at home, worried about their loved ones and wondering about getting basic supplies.
We all must make ethical decisions in this pandemic. Should I take that second pack of toilet paper for my family, or leave it for the next? Should essential workers stay home to protect themselves?
Responses are varied. Some people are showing grace under pressure. Some are responding with shock or panic, others seem to be wilfully ignoring the situation. Many have never experienced this type of crisis before, others are finding their traditional roadmaps breaking down: churches empty, political leaders losing trust, supermarkets ransacked, neighbours “sheltering in place” behind closed doors.
The more we read, the more anxious we become.
Stoicism is an ancient tool for remaining calm in adversity. Often dumbed down to refer to having a stiff upper lip, or emotional reserve, Stoicism is actually a deep philosophical framework, useful in providing an ethical scaffold for both everyday life and in times of difficulty.
Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that was founded by Zeno of Citium, in Athens, in the early 3rd century BC.
Stoics welcomed hard times – they saw their life as training for moments such as the one we are in now, where character, resilience and courage are tested. Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: “The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skilful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.”
He saw crisis as a way of unmasking who you really are: “Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.”
In times like this it’s easy to spiral into anxiety. The Stoics strived for tranquility and believed that our minds are powerful and create their own heaven or hell. Stoics such as the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius lived through the Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, an ancient pandemic that wiped out a third of the population. Philosopher and playwright Seneca had to deal at close range with despots such as Caligula and Nero (who eventually ordered his death), and both Marcus Aurelius and Seneca had to carry on after the death of their children.
A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus
They were calm, focused and courageous in the face of carnage. Seneca said: “We are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in the imagination than reality.”
Stoics prized rational thinking, acting on good information and contemplating the situation fully rather than acting rashly or from a place of panic and anxiety. Marcus Aurelius coped by not allowing his thoughts to be overrun by negativity. “The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make of it,” he wrote in his nightly diary. Those in quarantine in Wuhan also kept a diary as a way of coping.
A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus. Counselled Epictetus: “Other people’s views and troubles can be contagious. Don’t sabotage yourself by unwittingly adopting negative, unproductive attitudes through your associations with others.”
The Stoics believed that humans as social animals were created to support each other. Marcus Aurelius devoted himself to “do good to my fellow creatures and bear with them.”
No plague or injury can do more damage than you do to yourself through acts of bad character. Character is key for the Stoics. They believed that your health and your money can be taken away from you at any time – but no one can take your character from you. So you need to nurture it. It’s particularly important at times of global emergency where we need to pull together.
Demonstrating good character might involve not hoarding scarce goods such as toilet paper. It might mean not taking all the pasta and rice for yourself and leaving none for others. It might mean self-isolating not just for your own protection but to protect others. 
“Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness,” said Seneca.
When people in northern Italy escaped quarantine despite being ordered to do so, they spread the virus across the country, imperilling other communities. They acted out of fear and didn’t consider the wider good when taking action. 
Ancient Stoics recognised humans are highly social animals, and we exist and find meaning within our communities. Their philosophy reflected our deep and profound interconnectedness. According to Seneca, “we are waves of the same sea, leaves of the same tree, flowers of the same garden.”
It was no coincidence that when the Chinese sent boxes of medical supplies and face masks to Italy last week, the crates were all stamped with this quote.
As many of us lock down and go into social isolation to try to contain the spread of the virus, we are fearful about how we might cope for an indefinite period of time away from our friend, pleasures, routines and social life.
The Stoics have a lot to teach us about surviving quarantine – after all, a lot of them were exiled by angry rulers, and faced years trapped in a place and situation not of their choosing.
One of the most important Stoic teachers from ancient Rome, Gaius Musonius Rufus, was exiled to the small and desert-like island of Gyaros (in 65, the same year Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide). Seneca previously was exiled by Claudius to Corsica for eight years, just when his star was on the rise in ancient Rome.
Rather than being bitter at his fall from grace, Seneca used his time in exile to enjoy the natural world and think about the nature of life.
“Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company,” he said.
It also taught him that a bit of deprivation can be an excellent corrective – as you realise in good times you often become habituated to living a soft, decadent life.
In letters to his friend Lucilius, he wrote: “Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realise how unnecessary many things are. We’ve been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.”
When Boris Johnson said last week, “I must level with you, many families, many more families are going to lose loved ones” due to Covid-19, he was (maybe unwittingly) employing the Stoic technique of negative visualisation.
This technique involves thinking about what you value most in life, then imagine losing that thing. It might range from losing a precious piece of jewellery right through to imagining someone you love dying – in this case, dying from the virus.
Negative visualisation was practised by Stoics for a couple of reasons. This includes not only inoculating us to inevitable loss in life, but also enabling us to appreciate the people and things we love. Stoics believed that we are less likely to take someone for granted if we are aware that they may not be in our life forever. We might all be quarantined for quite a while. There are worse uses of your time than reading the Stoics. They have a lot to teach us.

'We have a responsibility': Fox News declares coronavirus a crisis in abrupt U-turn
","
Adam Gabbatt","Hosts encourage viewers to practice social distancing after weeks of downplaying the pandemic as an attack on the president


Tue 17 Mar 2020 19.24 GMT


Last modified on Tue 17 Mar 2020 19.34 GMT


Fox News, the rightwing channel that is a favorite of Donald Trump and conservatives across the US, spent the first weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak downplaying the threat of the virus.
Hosts often claimed that those warning of the danger were “panic pushers”, or engaged in “mass hysteria”. Some on Fox News even claimed it was all an effort to try to bring down the president.
But in recent days Fox News has performed an abrupt U-turn, and declared coronavirus a crisis.
On Tuesday, the three hosts of Fox & Friends, Fox News’ flagship morning program and a known favorite of Trump, co-hosted the show while practising social distancing, appearing on a split screen instead of their usual format of sitting together on a couch.
“We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Ainsley Earhardt told viewers. “So if you can keep your distance, and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly, and help our country as a nation.”
Three days earlier, Earnhardt struck a different tone, when she suggested people should take advantage of the crisis to take a trip.
“It’s actually the safest time to fly,” Earhardt had said. “Everyone I know that’s flying right now, terminals are pretty much dead – ghost towns.”
In minimizing the threat, Earhardt and her colleagues had been echoing Trump’s own response to coronavirus, which initially was to repeatedly downplay its impact. Yet one by one, Fox News hosts and personalities have fallen in line with doctors, health experts and science, in judging the coronavirus outbreak to be severe.
On 10 March Sean Hannity, Fox News’ most-watched host and a personal friend to Trump, accused the left of creating “hysteria”. He attempted to downplay Covid-19 by comparing it to the flu, and also suggested the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, was using it as an excuse to cancel rallies.
Hannity’s outlook had changed by last Friday.
“This virus is serious,” Hannity said. “We’ve been telling you that from day one. We need to take the flu seriously. We need to take cancer seriously, this virus seriously. Of course, we all need to prepare accordingly.”
There are signs that the shift is supported, or mandated, by Fox News executives. On Friday, Trish Regan’s show on Fox Business, which is owned by Fox News Media and echoes the conservative tone of the Fox News channel, was suspended after Regan offered a particularly strident avalanche of misinformation on air.
As the graphic: “Coronavirus impeachment hoax” appeared on screen, Regan claimed Democrats had created “mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off”.
Regan added: “Many in the liberal media [are] using [the] coronavirus to demonize and destroy the president.”
She also claimed the left was using “melodrama” in its response, and questioned why there was not the same response to Sars and Ebola, which she said were “far more deadly”. While they did have a higher mortality rate, only 8,000 people contracted Sars and 33,500 Ebola. As of Monday, 167,000 people have contracted Covid-19, in at least 150 countries.
“Why the melodrama?” she asked. “I’ll give you two words: Donald Trump.”
In a development that illustrates the strange times we find ourselves in, usually-controversial conservative host Tucker Carlson has been credited as one of the few Fox News personalities to treat the coronavirus seriously.
Carlson, who in the past has demonized immigrants and described white supremacy as a hoax, criticized those making light of coronavirus more than a week ago, describing it as a “major event”.
“People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem,” Carlson told viewers on 9 March, at the same time other Fox News hosts, and Trump, were doing that very thing.
“It’s just partisan politics, they say: ‘Calm down. In the end, this is just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass, and when it does, we will feel foolish for worrying about it.’
“That’s their position. But they’re wrong.”
The median age of a prime-time Fox News viewer is 66, meaning many viewers fall into the most at-risk category for complications from the coronavirus.
Carlson, who with Hannity makes up a cadre of Fox News hosts-cum-informal Trump advisers, reportedly took his concerns straight to the president earlier in March. Trump finally seemed to acknowledge the seriousness of the coronavirus on Monday, just as Fox News did the same. Whether the same sober tone lasts over the coming months remains to be seen."

Cursed Euro 2020 might just give us what we need next year
",Contact author," The 1950s idealism behind the European Championship has been replaced by a ludicrously distended tournament – but celebration and collectivism could re-emerge at Euro 2021

The lamps are going out. They will be lit again across Europe – 15 months from now if current timescales hold. Although what traumas the 12 host cities for Uefa’s Euros of Everywhere might have endured by then is open to uncomfortable speculation.
For now Rome’s piazzas are empty. Bucharest has declared a state of emergency. Madrid feels “like a meteorite has fallen on us”. As for the final venue, London, well, this place is coming like a ghost town.
The decision to postpone Euro 2020 was announced on Tuesday afternoon after a video‑link conference of Uefa’s member associations. But it came as a surprise to nobody.
Such is the speed of the news cycle it is hard to recall such ostensibly huge sporting news that has felt like such an afterthought.
This time last week Liverpool were preparing to take on Atlético Madrid at Anfield and the established version of sporting reality seemed to be holding, just about. It took us a week to get from there to here. What paradigm shifts will the next five weeks hold? European football does at least have a revised, sensible-looking start date for this benighted, cumbersome sporting white elephant. Euro 2020 is now officially Euro 2021, destined to run from 11 June to 11 July with details and logistics to fall into step behind.
What to make of this? It has become a reflex action to quail and froth at every decision made by the executive in every sphere. In reality there is no good solution to any of this, just as the postponement of European football’s £2bn cash cow shrinks into insignificance alongside the wider effects of the current viral slowdown.
Like every other industry football is faced with guesswork, compromise and a sharp-faced divvying up of the remaining wealth and space.
There is at least time now to regroup and salvage something of the great global circus; and to make some brittle-looking plans. The Champions League final has been put on hold, with some speculation of a final in high summer although it is worth remembering such statements are not solely directed at the watching public.
The key discussions now are with rights holders, sponsors, insurers and above all lawyers. Best efforts are being made, just as best efforts must always be made where huge contractual payments are at issue. Pencil that date in. But not too heavily. In reality we are all subject to events now, and to an altered perspective.
For those consumed by football’s weekly operetta it seems axiomatic that domestic competitions must be completed, that the world turns on these certainties. It is worth bearing in mind current projections are for peak-infection to arrive in the UK in early June. How will football feel in a world of isolation, infection, body counts and potential health‑service collapse? There is a time to play games. Whatever the illusion of control, we are all essentially spectators to this wider drama.
Beyond the coming summer Uefa will have to decide what it wants to do with the women’s Euros, which would overlap this revised men’s tournament by four days.
Perhaps the day will arrive sooner rather than later when, as in tennis, men’s and women’s tournaments can be played near-simultaneously, although that is a wider debate about visibility and projection. Separately there is also the Nations League (won’t someone think of the Nations League?) to be crammed in and World Cup 2022 qualifiers to be negotiated.
These questions of scheduling can all be solved. The wider issue once seasons have been fudged and losses minimised is exactly where this leaves us. Football in the time of pandemic; in the time of anti-globalism; in an increasingly perilous-seeming world. How should it work? What’s the plan? Certainly this has always felt like a cursed tournament. Welcome to the Damned Euros. Will we ever be free of them? At the start of all this Michel Platini called his pan‑European show “zany, but a good idea”. In practice it has been neither.
Uefa’s plan was a product of the banking meltdown in Europe, which deprived football of a suitably lavish and willing host. The border‑hopping, low-cost air‑travel compromise was a response to this. Eight years on The Euros of Everywhere occupies a neat but sickly position, bookended by two global crises.
There is something extra poignant in their failure. The European Championship was conjured initially out of a spirit of hope, and of internationalism. Henri Delaunay, the first general secretary of Uefa, was hugely enthused by the ideals of the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor to the EU. His championship, the first edition of which eventually kicked off two years after his death, was in some small part a force for integration and progress.
That skein of idealism has of course been consumed by the urge to expand and monetise this wildly successful arm of the entertainment industry.
At the end of which Uefa has ended up bringing us this ludicrously distended version, with matches staged 3,200 miles apart, and one quarter-final due to take place at a point east of Riyadh.
Even before the current crisis this has not been a story of endless growth. The Euros has looked for some time like an ailing, overstretched concept. Last time around the players were tired, the football lukewarm, the 24-team structure a failure.
 What was decided today?
The European Championship will not take place this summer, with Uefa rescheduling it for 11 June to 11 July 2021. European football’s governing body also decided that play-off matches for Euro 2020 and international friendlies due to take place at the end of March will be played in the international window at the start of June, subject to a review of the situation with coronavirus. There may be further complications should the Republic of Ireland qualify for the Euros, with their manager, Mick McCarthy, due to be replaced by Stephen Kenny in August, and several other managers of qualified nations are out of contract in June, including Belgium’s Roberto Martínez.
What does it mean for Champions League and Europa League?
Uefa has established a working group with the participation of leagues and club representatives and aims “to complete all domestic and European club competitions by the end of the current sporting season, ie 30 June 2020 at the latest, should the situation improve and resuming playing be appropriate and prudent enough”.
What about the women’s Euros?
Scheduled to begin on 7 July 2021 at Old Trafford – four days before the men’s final will now take place at Wembley – Uefa has said the tournament will move but not to when. A year’s delay is an option. The Nations League finals and Under-21 Championship, also scheduled for summer 2021, will be rearranged too. Fifa’s newly expanded World Club Cup, due in China between 17 June and 4 July 2021, should move, its president, Gianni Infantino, said.
What if I have Euro 2020 tickets?
Uefa wants the format of 24 teams playing across 12 venues to stay and has said all tickets are transferable, with existing ticket buyers and hospitality clients able to claim refunds “for the face value of their tickets and packages in full”.
Euro 2016 ended with French fans mooching out of the Stade de France as Portugal’s players took the fireworks, and a general sense of relief that an event staged under a state of national emergency had come to a peaceful end.
In the meantime football’s calendar has become more bloated, the product stretched ever thinner. Even assuming a mass recovery, the players will face a brutal catch-up programme, with club competitions sliced and diced, and a rearranged Euros followed by a rearranged winter World Cup the following year.
In the middle of which, here’s one hopeful thought. It seems likely Europe will now enter a time of austerity, uncertainty, even horror. Sport has always been at its best as a source of celebration and collectivism, as a note of beauty that stands outside the real world. A Euros in 2021 does at least offer the promise of some kind of re‑emergence. Distant as it seems, it could even be a time of joy."

Bernard Tomic endures blizzard of uncharitable scorn in self-isolation

Kevin Mitchell","For all his flaws and wasted gifts, he surely does not deserve the vilification that has fallen upon him


Tue 17 Mar 2020 09.31 GMT

When Bernard Tomic announced he was the first player on the ATP tour to self-isolate after showing symptoms of coronavirus, the 27-year-old Australian was not drowned in universal sympathy.
The Covid-19 pandemic has loosened the worst and best instincts of humanity and Tomic, who could have been one of the outstanding players of his generation, endured mostly a blizzard of scorn after telling an Australian newspaper on Sunday: “Since Tuesday, I started feeling not right. I already had shortness of breath and my immune system was low and run down. I’m currently in Miami and isolated away from everyone, as advised. I’m yet to be tested for [Covid-19] but I have all the symptoms.”
He will not lack for expert advice close to home; his mother, Ady, was a biomedical scientist. Quite what his belligerent father, John, will tell him is another matter.
Tomic believes he may have been infected while flying to Florida from one of his favourite tournaments, Monterrey, where he lost against his compatriot Aleksandar Vukic in the third round. But most fans were not interested. Tomic, who rose to a career-high 17 in the world in 2016 and now wallows at 200, could not buy a friend. 
The social media onslaught was relentless. “I think he’s just had dickheaditis,” said one. “Since when did he become Dr Bernard Tomic?” asked another. There were a slew of laughing memes and gifs, as well as abuse and nastiness. “Let’s hope he stays there forever,” was typical. One budding comedian observed: “Apparently he was lethargic, tired and could not chase the tennis ball. It was a wonder he was diagnosed at all, no difference to his normal behaviour.”
He has heard it for years. It was uncharitable, obviously, and, sadly, predictable. It confirmed what is obvious: memories can be short and unkind, especially when the target is a celebrity athlete with a history of entitlement and ordinary behaviour.
It should have been – and could have been – different. However, it was evident from the start of his career that Tomic was temperamentally ill-equipped to handle fame. He blundered from one minor public relations disaster to another, losing to players way below him in the rankings, and seeming not to care, as the money rolled in.
When Mischa Zverev blew him away in less than an hour-and-a-half in the first round at Wimbledon three years ago, he said he had no regrets, was bored and did not much like tennis. “Throughout my career I’ve given 100%,” he said. “I’ve given also 30%.” He then blew it up altogether: “Wouldn’t anyone want to take a job in ... one of the biggest sports in the world and only give 50, 60% and earn millions of dollars?”
His website has been dormant for years. The last result posted was his injury retirement after three games against Benoît Paire in the first round of the 2016 Italian Open. It was one of many such results, seen by his team as evidence of a failing body and zero focus, by his critics as a deficit of spirit.
On Facebook, he often showed his good side. His last entry, in February 2013, captioned a visit to a children’s hospital: “La Timone in Marseille this week, really enjoyed the experience – chatting and signing autographs with the kids.”
Not a lot has gone right for Tomic since he came through qualifying to take a set off Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2011. That might have been his breakthrough moment, as fans thrilled to his languid game. He showed exquisite touches and bursts of lazy power but not enough resilience under pressure when Djokovic stepped on the gas. Still, it was something memorable for a teenager to build on.
In fits and starts, injury and hubris undermined his talent thereafter. Arrogance and ignorance did not help. He went from prodigy to Tomic the Tank Engine. Patrick and John McEnroe called him out at Flushing Meadows in 2012 when he collapsed spectacularly against Andy Roddick. Tomic responded: “That’s how I play. Do you have a problem with that?”
For all his flaws and wasted gifts, he surely does not deserve the vilification that has fallen upon him in a health crisis such as the one he is enduring now. “People need to take this super seriously,” he told the Sydney Sun-Herald, “especially at home in Australia. I don’t know how long I’ll be in isolation or when I can be tested.”
Tomic may not realise it but he has been isolated for many years."

NBA superstar Kevin Durant said he is among the four Brooklyn Nets players to have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a report.
The Nets confirmed on Tuesday that four players had returned positive tests for Covid-19, less than a week after the global outbreak prompted the suspension of the NBA season.
Later on Tuesday, Durant confirmed to NBA reporter Shams Charania that he was one of them, adding: “Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We’re going to get through this.”
Kevin Durant tested positive for coronavirus, Durant tells @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. Durant says he is feeling fine: ""Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We're going to get through this.""
Three of the players were asymptomatic while one was showing symptoms of the rapidly-spreading virus, days after the Utah Jazz reported that two of their players had also tested positive.
The Nets said in a written statement that all four players were isolated and under the care of team physicians, but individuals remained unnamed until the two-time NBA finals Most Valuable Player came forward later in the afternoon.
“The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,” the team said.
“All players and members of the Nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff.”
The team last played against the Lakers in Los Angeles on 10 March. A day later, the league suspended its season until further notice, as the coronavirus pandemic upended major sporting events across the globe.
The Lakers will administer coronavirus testing on their players on Wednesday before going into a 14-day self-quarantine, according to a Los Angeles Times report.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and coughing. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.
The Nets said that all players and members of their travel party are being asked to remain isolated and closely monitor their health, but the team’s ability to get testing that has been unavailable to so many others drew criticism from New York mayor Bill de Blasio.
We wish them a speedy recovery. But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick. https://t.co/7uQlL3zc7Z
“We wish them a speedy recovery. But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested,” De Blasio wrote on Twitter. “Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick.”
The Nets were scheduled to face the Golden State Warriors on 12 March in San Francisco for a game that was to be played without fans before the NBA season was suspended after Utah’s Rudy Gobert tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.
“I saw that news,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of the Nets’ positive tests while speaking on a conference call. “I’m hoping none of our players went and hung out with guys the night before our game. I don’t know if that’s the case or not.”
Kerr added that he didn’t need to be convinced that suspending the season was the correct decision.
“I think everything that’s happened since the league shut down was enough proof that we did the right thing, that the NBA did the right thing and that we need to follow the advice of the experts out there and everybody’s got to do their part.”
Gobert’s Jazz teammate Donovan Mitchell and Detroit’s Christian Wood are the other NBA players who have tested positive.
The Nets said they are currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting."

How do you feel? I’m not asking if you have a temperature and a cough. What I mean is: how do you feel in yourself? How are you coping emotionally? I ask because, since we have all become amateur and (frankly, quite crap) epidemiologists, we have been ignoring what really matters. Because so much of what happens next in the coronavirus crisis depends on our emotional responses.
I was ill last week, and pretty much self-isolated. Easy enough for me – it’s something I have done for 20 years anyway as a freelance writer. But when I did go out, I saw restaurants that were packed with people, and chatted on the bus to a 76-year-old who was full of beans, despite having just come out of hospital, having had pneumonia. She was not going to stop living her life, she told me, and she wouldn’t be doing anything she was being advised to do. No self-isolation for her.
I wonder if she will be arrested for being so sparky, when the new police powers that have been floated come in. She may well be in denial. That’s how the whole of the UK apparently looks to the rest of Europe. Denial is about not wanting to feel afraid or not feeling entitled to voice fear. What works in such a situation is to say that, yes, we are all afraid and it is OK to be afraid. To admit to that is one of the steps that will help us get through this.
The reality is that for any self-isolation or quarantine to work, we need to be willing – even if just for now – to be compliant. And that depends on a level of emotional intelligence that seems to be severely lacking in our culture.
Slagging off Boris Johnson seems another form of denial. Would Jeremy Corbyn be doing any better? If scoring party-political points at a time like this is your priority, you have the incurable virus of self-righteousness. Sorry. People will die in huge numbers, and it is true, of course, that inequality and austerity kills. This is not new information, but this virus is new and how we behave cannot be based on how we behaved three months or even three days ago. We don’t have enough ventilators, hospital beds or the testing that seems more important than ever in how we move forward; arguing and point-scoring won’t help with those essential, urgent practicalities.
The resilience of those who refuse to change their behaviour after a terror attack – the people who go out anyway – is absolutely no use here. The virus doesn’t care about your bravery, your politics or your views on globalisation. It doesn’t care if you trust the government or hate Brexit.
It doesn’t matter if you are a catastrophist (“it’s the end times”) or a conspiracy theorist (“this is a cull of those we can’t pay for any more”). What matters now is whether people will take the only advice there is: scrupulous hand-washing and self-isolation.
There is all sorts of nonsense being talked about the blitz spirit
Some things we know will help. When people are in terrifying situations – say, in the military – it helps to give them lots of things to do. Activity can help conquer fear. Loneliness stresses the immune system, so if our old people are to be isolated, we at least have the tech now to connect. Teach your elderly folk how to Skype.
The mad scramble for toilet paper is understandable, as it allows people to feel that they are responding to a crisis – that they are therefore mid-crisis – and able to imagine a time when the crisis ends. But it is no more helpful than the opposite response: keep calm and carry on. There is all sorts of nonsense being talked about the blitz spirit, all of which ignores the fact that during the blitz many people had breakdowns and suffered what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder.
Behavioural science can tell us only so much, just as data science has its limitations. There are those, though, who have studied people’s reactions to disaster. Sandro Galea, the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, has written about the five stages of reaction, which I will summarise here as: 1) self-preservation: fear and anxiety; 2) group preservation, where changes in social behaviour begin; 3) blame-setting: the psychological consequences fall into place as we realise we have to change our normal activities; 4) justice-seeking: we want to see what and who caused the disaster; 5) renormalising – basically, we have adapted to the crisis and its consequences.
As with stages of grief, these processes are not linear, but, right now, we are at stage one. Indeed, we have to legitimise fear in order to make necessary changes.
There is no going back to pre-virus times. Priorities will have to be reordered. Not all work matters that much. Not all flights have to be taken. Those in authority have very little. The NHS and its staff is the most precious resource this country has. No one will doubt that again.
We need now to create community at a distance; a new way of being – and please no one else send me that video of Italians bloody singing. What helps you may not help me. And vice versa.
Let us have our own individual responses and anxieties, because this is how we adapt to the new normal. I don’t yet know what this is any more than you do. Living with uncertainty is hard, but uncertainty has been the emotional pandemic of recent years anyway.
Those who know anything for sure right now are precisely those that I trust the least. I reread The Plague last week, in between necking paracetamol and arguing on Twitter. My God, Camus is great.
“There’s no question of heroism in all this,” he writes. “It’s a matter of common decency. That’s an idea which may make some people smile, but the only means of fighting a plague is – common decency.”
Will common decency survive the virus? Will we find it within ourselves? I don’t know, but that seems to me the only vaccine we have.

","Italy’s Salvini and others on the far right could weaponise people’s despair. Democratic governments must fight them with transparency 
If the coronavirus pandemic is fuelling any political hope, it is that this crisis is a robust nail in the coffin of populist politics. Surely, some argue, in the face of an entirely indiscriminate, unforeseen and formidable plague, for which no one can be blamed (unlike, say, greedy bankers and unscrupulous lenders in the global financial crisis, or the terrorists of 9/11) people will turn to the truth, to science and to expert-led government.
And, true, populist leaders seem to have lost their voice, for now: the attempts to blame migrants, porous borders and the forces of globalisation for the coronavirus have received short shrift. Fear and deference have, momentarily at least, rendered citizens less inclined to question mainstream governments and turn to populism’s snake oil vendors. Better still: it looks as though governments led by populists or populists-lite, such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, are set for a rough ride, too, unless they change their ways.
No one expected many Chinese citizens to question their government’s robust coronavirus response, but Italian attitudes, so far, add to the sense of populism’s – probably greatly exaggerated – demise. If Italy can be counted on to listen to the orders of a government that only a few weeks ago was viewed as accidental and temporary, perhaps the tide has turned on the populist Lega party leader Matteo Salvini.
And, if it has turned on Salvini, why should it not have turned on all populists? True, there is something quite remarkable about Italy’s forbearance in the face of this shock. But a couple of caveats. First, whereas these certainly are extraordinary times, Italy has always been resilient to shocks. Terrorism, migration, corruption, the financial crisis and regular, devastating earthquakes have not brought it to its knees. Indeed, the earthquakes have a lot to do with the manner in which health, police, army and emergency services are reacting now, and why Italy does a fine line in civil contingency, and its citizens an even finer line in social solidarity.
Powerful cities; strong regions; an excellent – if decentralised – healthcare system; hi-tech industry; a web of resilient firms and civil society organisations; its own, local food production, creativity and expertise in spades (including in the highest echelons of its civil service), all despite significant regional variations, account for its capacity to respond to crises. These qualities are in evidence today – as always. But they have not been enough in the past to ward off populism, a force that can be reignited at a stroke in tumultuous times. Think already of the reaction, including on the Italian far right, to remarks made by Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, that suggested that Italy would have to cope alone.
Another caveat: it is early days – for every nation. I, too, want to believe that there will be a significant turn against populist politics, but I have worries. The first is that much depends on whether the draconian measures taken in Italy, France and Spain, and elsewhere in Europe, are seen to make a big difference. Even if the various closures and lockdowns are effective at containing the spread of the virus, it will be very difficult to assert counterfactuals: “it could have been so much worse” never quite cuts it, because it sounds too politically convenient.
My second worry is what if this is only wave one of a number of coronavirus epidemics? If the virus mutates, if it is seasonal, if the different timelines of different countries create different waves of contagion and crisis, then governments will have to admit that different measures might have been needed and that we are all still learning. Such incrementalism and humility will be a difficult political message to manage. And over time will governments actually find themselves confronting populations that are grief stricken and economically poorer (that is inevitable) but also frustrated and angry – ready to acquiesce to, or even demand, more authoritarianism?
Salvini’s Lega may be haemorrhaging support, but that support is flowing mainly to the party to the (far) right of them, the Brothers of Italy. The point is that crises such as this don’t necessarily show populist politics up for the fraud it is. They can also have reverse results. Genuine scientific disagreements can be weaponised as conspiracy theories; legitimate hesitation dressed up as incompetence; and failures used to justify increasingly authoritarian measures and positions. Could the severity of the Covid-19 crisis serve as justification for the postponement or annulment of a major national election? Unlikely still, but not unthinkable.
The assumption we tend to make is that if this shock encourages people to turn away from populism, it will mark a return to governments of the late 20th century. But this is to fundamentally misunderstand the path that we have all been on for the past few decades.
And this is the third, and most important, worry: we continue to think we can “go back” but those waters have closed behind us. We need to move into something new that associates expertise, knowledge and information. A combination of digital technology and populist politics has led us to an era of what I call populocracy. And while we need urgently to reassert truth, science and reason, how we source this expertise and ensure legitimacy for it will be a fundamental challenge.
What will eventually rid us of populism in our time of cholera is the capacity of pluralists and true democrats to win back trust in objective facts and expertise in ways that make sense to the public. This will be in part measured by the success of the measures taken against the pandemic, of course. But, in a crisis that promises to initially overwhelm our systems, and record nothing but loss of life and defeat, success will also be about demonstrating that whatever was done, was done with people’s needs in mind, especially those of the least well off and the most vulnerable.
Governments must also demonstrate that they can use digital technology and its promise of shared information and expertise for the greater good and with the greatest flexibility. This is the time to become truly open and resist hunkering down on communications. 
Unless governments realise the need to be transparent about decision-making, unless they open up to consensus-building and consent, the crisis we are in will overtake them. Populist accusations of incompetence, opacity and manipulation will ring true for some again. They are bound to, because many will suffer great losses.
In this respect, the coronavirus crisis is a test of progressive politics — a test of solidarity, but also a test of transparency. It is an opportunity to show that a new diffused technocracy can be to the benefit of the greater good. It is an opportunity to show that to grow trust in government you trust the citizen. This is what will rescue us from the coronavirus, and the virus of populism.

","The truth is the Covid-19 test doesn’t change anything. Even without it we can all make a difference now • Australia coronavirus live: NSW government announces $2.3bn stimulus package
I’m standing at the entrance of a Covid-19 testing unit for a major Sydney hospital, being quizzed by a nurse about my symptoms.
“I’m sorry,”, she says. “I’ve had a lot of people lying to me to try to get tested. I have to be careful.”
It soon becomes clear that I meet the criteria for testing for coronavirus and I’m given a sticker with a number on it.
I join a quiet room full of people, each with a mask and a sticker. Staff members, wearing protective gloves, gowns, face masks and eye covering, are coming around to get each person’s details. Next, your “vital signs” – that is your heart and breathing rate, temperature, oxygenation and blood pressure – are recorded.
The woman sitting next to me sniffs loudly, then sneezes, and I shift uncomfortably in my chair. Being in a room full of people who all certainly have viruses and may possibly have Covid-19, is not relaxing. I think about how many items of my clothing, my bag and my umbrella are touching the area around me, and I wonder idly about how long the virus lasts on surfaces and if it can transfer from surface to surface.
Suddenly, the explosive cough that has been surprising me all week bursts once again from my mouth. My neighbour who sneezed earlier startles and shifts away from me in her chair. I don’t blame her. We are close together and I could feel my breath forcefully pushing out the sides of my mask.
After half an hour we are moved to a different set of chairs, waiting to move through to the testing area.
If you are worried you have coronavirus, you should act as if you do have it
At this point I realise I am one of the lucky ones. By now the line outside the clinic is snaking around the corner. As each new person gets to the front, they are imploring the nurse to let them in.
“But my friend was travelling and she is sick!”
“I’ve been living in a hotel and I don’t know who was there!”
Many respond with anger when she advises them they don’t meet guidelines for testing, that they should go home, self-isolate until their symptoms subside or they are advised otherwise. That they are better off not sitting in a room surrounded by sick people for two hours.
“Are you seriously telling me you don’t care about this??!” one man exclaims.
“But my work says I need a certificate to come in,” begs another.
Most are scared. They want to get tested because they want reassurance in what is frankly a confusing, unsettling time.
Ideally we would test people as widely as possible, but at the moment Australia is one of many countries affected by a worldwide shortage of testing kits. There is a real opportunity cost to testing people who don’t meet the criteria. In some labs they are being forced to delay or stop other important tests because they simply don’t have the resources to meet demand.
When it’s finally time to be tested, my details and symptoms are recorded again by another gowned staff member before I’m taken into a testing room. One swab (which looks like a giant cotton bud) is held at a right angle to my head and pushed inside my nostril, further back than it seems possible to go. It feels scratchy and sore just above my throat. Then the same swab is used again in the other side, before being placed in a bag and sent off. The whole thing takes only a couple of minutes but consumes a large amount of staff time and personal protective equipment.
Afterwards, my throat and nose are sore. And I feel oddly marked. Like somehow just by virtue of taking the test my status as a potential carrier has changed.
But the truth is, the test doesn’t change anything.
So if you don’t meet the criteria for testing right now, don’t panic.
There is still so much you can do. If you are worried you have coronavirus, you should act as if you do have it. Self-isolate. Be meticulous with hand-washing. Having a positive test won’t get you any better treatment in any way.
If you or someone you employ has viral symptoms, now is the time for you to show moral leadership. Don’t turn up at these overrun testing centres unless you meet the testing criteria for your state. Don’t require your employees to be tested or get a medical certificate. Just let them stay at home.
Two hours in a testing centre and an uncomfortable swab up the nose won’t change anything. If you become very unwell you will be managed the same way, and you will be tested anyway. Even without the tests, we can all make a difference now.

Trump sees the coronavirus as a threat to his self-interest – not to people

","Trump has made it clear he sees this pandemic chiefly as a threat to the market and wealthy people’s interests (and relatedly, his political future)
A fictional film about a US president mismanaging the response to a dangerous pandemic would never depict its lead character anywhere near as selfish and bumbling as Donald Trump in the age of Covid-19. He’d be too cartoonish and inept to be believable.
And yet, here we are. At a press conference on Sunday – the same day that state governors declared closures of bars and restaurants and when the Covid-19 death count shot up in Italy – the American president spent more time gushing over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut, heaping praise on big corporate retailers for keeping Americans well-supplied, and praising Friday’s rise in the stock market (“almost 2,000 points!”) than, say, addressing the health concerns of the public.
Trump’s response goes beyond incompetence – it’s a political abomination. However uncoordinated his administration’s moves have been, Trump has made it clear he sees this pandemic chiefly as a threat to the market and wealthy people’s personal interests (and relatedly, his own political future) – not to the people whose lives it will threaten or claim.
“What’s happened with the Fed is phenomenal news,” Trump gushed at the press conference, “what’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news!” “Relax,” he later continued, “we’re doing great, it all will pass.” These words hardly matched the reality on the ground, as Covid-19 was shutting down whole nations across Europe, and American hospitals were cancelling elective surgeries to prepare for a potential surge of the critically ill.
Trump and his allies’ impulse to protect the powerful led the administration to undercut the nation’s public health infrastructure long before the rise of coronavirus – a fact that helps contextualize his response today. For instance, he signed an executive order in January 2017 that froze hiring of federal workers, leading to almost 700 vacancies at the Centers of Disease Control (CDC); some such positions were at a key department that “regulates some of the world’s most dangerous bacteria and viruses and manages the nation’s stockpile of emergency medical countermeasures”, the Washington Post reported.
That same year, Trump and congressional Republicans nearly succeeded in passing a bill that would have gutted Medicaid – and that also would have eliminated the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the source of 12% of the CDC’s budget. Such cuts had one big beneficiary: corporations and the very wealthy, who would have seen big tax cuts had the repeal legislation passed. Later, in 2018, it disbanded the White House’s pandemic office charged with responding to outbreaks like Covid-19 – putting no leadership structure in its place.
Since the pandemic began, the administration has hardly reprioritized. As Politico’s Dan Diamond reported, Trump opposed evacuating a cruise ship that was stuck off the coast of California, even though it seemed like the right thing to do, noting that: “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” As Diamond suggested in an interview on National Public Radio’s Fresh Air, “[t]he lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.”
In that same vein, the president has baselessly boosted the stock market while providing deceptive public health reassurances. “The Coronavirus,” he tweeted on 24 February, “is very much under control in the USA … Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”
Trump built on this idea last Friday. At a press conference where he finally declared Covid-19 a national emergency, Trump bizarrely passed the microphone to one corporate CEO after another – “celebrities in their own right”, he gushed, “… the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world”. After the conference, he sent a note to his supporters, obtained and reported by CNN, that trumpeted: “From opening of press conference, biggest day in stock market history!” It included a graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with his signature – as much a statement of his political priorities as historians are likely to uncover.
Sooner or later, however, Trump will realize that he cannot bullshit his way past biology. Viruses are immune to propaganda; Covid-19 will advance regardless of Trump’s avarice. From his push to grind up Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the rich in 2017, to his bungling stock-market-obsessed response to Covid-19 in 2020, Trump and company have elevated self-interest above life."

How to survive isolation with your roommates, your partner, your kids – and yourself

Adrienne Matei","With millions of us lying low to limit the spread of Covid-19, how best to manage being cooped up for days on end?


Tue 17 Mar 2020 14.07 GMT

By now, we all know that voluntary social distancing is key to mitigating the spread of Covid-19. In the grand scheme of things, lying low for a little while is a small sacrifice to make for the increased safety of all, though it certainly will pose challenges, not least of which being to our relationships.
“It will become easy to think of one another as a burden,” writes the Atlantic’s Helena Fitzgerald, “especially when we are cooped up together or when isolation breeds feelings of abandonment.” This raises the question: how can we best manage the unusual social circumstances we’re in?
In 2017, engineer Ansley Barnard spent eight months living in an isolated dome habitat with five other scientists as part of Nasa’s Hi-SEAS program, which was developed to simulate the experience of traveling to Mars. During that time, she learned several lessons applicable to anyone living with roommates.
“Talking about a potential conflict early on prevents things from getting worse,” says Barnard. “Our strategies in the habitat were to be open about our feelings and avoid blame. It can help to carve out private places in the same home so that you can decompress alone if you need to,” she says.
Barnard and her team ate dinner together every evening, using that time to set aside any issues and work on their relationships with each other. “I think having a positive attitude and looking at your situation as a temporary opportunity instead of a setback can help keep you moving forward,” she says.
According to Joshua David Stein, editor of the parenting publication Fatherly, if you’re practicing social distancing with your kids, now is the time to readjust your rule structure.
“Just like how when you take kids on a plane they can watch as much TV as they want – it’s kind of the same, at least for now,” he says. Fatherly has compiled a list of at-home activities for bored kids, the internet abounds with kid-friendly podcasts, museum tours and educational videos, and Stein notes that it’s a good time to get outside and take advantage of local parks, too.
If your kids are worried about grandparents they’re unable to visit during the pandemic, Stein suggests: “without lying, frame it in a way that will assuage their worries as much as possible. Like, ‘Grandma is doing fine, for her safety and our safety, we’re going to rely on FaceTime for now.’” It’s also to be expected that your patience will wear thin at times. “You’re going to freak out at your kids a little bit,” says Stein. “It’s not the best thing in the world but it’s not the end of the world, don’t beat yourself up about it, try to do better next time.”
“This is a situation where you kind of know what is going to happen so you have time to come up with a gameplan,” says Erin Davidson, a couples and sex therapist. “Chat about what to do in moments where things are stressful – normalize that it’s OK if you get on each other’s nerves, and decide on a signal that means ‘OK, we need to take a moment in separate rooms, or recognize better communication is needed, or perhaps someone needs a hug or to talk about emotions that are coming up.’”
Davidson says both partners should get comfortable asking for – and giving each other – space. While it may be a tricky time to date, low-risk, symptom-free partners living in relative isolation together can certainly use this time to have more sex. “There’s a website called MojoUpgrade.com and it’s fun because both of you fill out ‘yes-no-maybe’ questions about sexual things you want to try individually, and then it only emails you with the things you both matched up with a ‘yes’ on,” she says. “It’s a low-pressure fun thing you can do.”
For the last three years, writer and musician Kristal Jax has been making ironic, Barbie-heavy memes about coping with mental illness, trauma and social issues, which she posts to her Instagram account @Dyingbutfine. Several of Jax’s recent posts have centered on Covid-19, including a “quarantine bingo” meme and a multi-post filled with ideas for how to distract yourself while home alone, such as by crafting, cleaning or making your own memes. “I find humour is a way to connect and let off steam when you’re really upset or anxious – just have some kind of catharsis,” she says.
In addition to taking on domestic projects, Jax says reaching out to offer support to others, if you’re able, is a good way to feel less alone. “I find helping people during times of crisis really helps you control your own anxiety, because you’re like, ‘Oh, I have a purpose,’” she says. “If you don’t know someone well enough to know how they would feel about you checking in on them you could still send a message to them saying, ‘Hey, I’m checking in on friends right now, do you need anything?’” And if you’re completely cooped up, “know that you staying home is you doing something,” says Jax, “even if you feel powerless.”"

As a telemarketer for a range of charities, Clare Hamman spends a lot of time on the phone. In the last couple of weeks, conversation with those on the other end has started to veer off-topic: “I was hearing so many people say ‘what’s going on?’, ‘I can’t afford to stockpile’ and ‘what do I do?’” she says, explaining that many of the people she reaches at home during the day are pensioners or unemployed.
Hamman turned to a Facebook group about coronavirus updates for help. She posted asking for suggestions around how Australians with limited budgets could prepare to self-isolate when they can’t afford to bulk buy groceries, and plans to compile the tips into a fact sheet that can be shared on social media.
Respondents shared advice for grocery shopping on the cheap, as well as broader ideas for ways to pitch in – like checking in on elderly neighbours, or creating WhatsApp groups to keep in touch with people on their street. “People genuinely had good tips and practical ideas about what to do,” she says. “They wanted to help.”
The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.
The UN agency advises people to:
Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.
Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. In the UK any household where a person develops a fever or a new continuous cough are recommended to self-isolate for 14 days.

As the Covid-19 pandemic unfolds, Australians have turned to online communities like these for support and assistance. Some are in Facebook groups, others have set up on Reddit boards or taken over parenting forums. As well as just assuaging anxieties, these online spaces have become sites of grassroots responses to a crisis where physically showing up for each other isn’t a solution.
Of course, this being the internet, not every comment in these communities is constructive. But enough are: in the same Covid-19 group that Clare Hamman posted in, others offered advice on how to care for kids with asthma or relatives in poor health. Some members posted tips on how they planned to share essentials with neighbours without coming into physical contact; one woman encouraged those with tissues or toilet paper to spare to give it away.
“Let’s show the world how we react in a crisis and that we are kind and not selfish!!!” she wrote, backed up by a barrage of likes and comments. Toilet paper is a common topic of these posts: on Reddit, users have directed those out of the community to check their local buy-swap-sell groups on Facebook, where people are arranging to share their supply with others in their neighbourhood.
When Melbourne resident Regina George offered to give away spare toilet paper on a buy-swap-sell group on 5 March, she received hundreds of positive messages, “from people just telling me how my post had restored their faith in humanity, and many messages of thanks. I only had about 15 people ask for the toilet paper and I ended up giving out more than I advertised.”
She continues: “Several people contacted me wanting to give me toilet paper so I could give away more but I told them to just do what I did.” The Facebook page took notice and “decided that no one was allowed to sell toilet paper on their page. That made me so happy and now I set others doing the same and giving it away.”
Dianne Regan, who founded an Australia coronavirus group six weeks ago, feels communities like hers exist to plug the gap left by what many perceive as an inadequate government response. “I feel angry at the government that they’ve waited so long to inform people. We don’t want fear-mongering and people panicking, but they should have been giving better directives and information to the public so that Australians wouldn’t be out clearing shelves and fighting with each other over toilet paper.”
She admits that the mood in the group is “mixed”, but thinks that it’s ultimately a hopeful space. “The number one rule for the group is that people need to be supportive, they need to be kind and respect that people have different anxiety levels.”
Nextdoor, an app that allows users to connect with others in their neighbourhood, has seen a “big spike” in engagement and sign-ups over the past week. They say many Australians are using the app to arrange how they can lend a hand to others in their local area. “We saw people using Nextdoor during the bushfires to help each other out with evacuations or rescuing each other’s animals, so I’m not surprised to see everybody turning to [the app] in this situation as well,” says Jennie Sager, the company’s Australian Country Manager.
In response to the Covid-19 crisis, Nextdoor has created a functionality on the app that allows users to mark themselves as “able to help” their neighbours. “It pre-populates a post which you can edit to say how you can help – for instance I can leave groceries at your front door, or I can pick up your prescriptions,” Sager says. “We launched that over the weekend and saw it instantly take off.” The app has also created a flyer with basic information that can be printed off and put in the mailbox or under the front door of elderly neighbours who might not be on the internet.
Dan Suan, a clinical immunologist at one of Sydney’s biggest hospitals, used Facebook this weekend to spread another message. In a group for Australia and New Zealand doctors to discuss Covid-19, he wrote a post stressing the importance of immediate social distancing to limit the spread of the virus. It was later reposted publicly on his wall and has now been shared over 11,000 times. Suan thinks the post resonated because it offered a practical solution to the crisis.
“I think people read that and thought, ‘oh my goodness, the answer to this epidemic doesn’t lie outside. It’s not the government, it’s not the hospitals, it lies in me and my personal responsibility,’” he tells Guardian Australia. “It’s a really positive social message. It’s about what we can do to actually turn the tide of this epidemic for our country and I think it’s helping people. There’s so much fear and anxiety out there at the moment that people feel helpless, and the post gave them something they can do.”
Outside of designated Covid-19 groups, some are using their personal social media pages – and the downtime social distancing has given them – to help in creative ways. On his Instagram, Melbourne artist Grant Jonathon asked for volunteers to help with deliveries and errands for those who are currently isolating. Australians who can help were encouraged to comment with where they live, so that those stuck at home could scan for someone available in their area.Abroad, when UK filmmaker Jeanie Finlay found her upcoming film shoot cancelled by coronavirus, she used her social media to offer free mentoring sessions over Skype to documentary filmmakers. “No charge, no catch, just something [positive] in these uncertain times,” she wrote. Right now, those are words for the internet to live by.

'It's really irresponsible': pop stars criticise fans over coronavirus inaction
", • Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellations,"Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and Camila Cabello have all appealed to their millions of followers to take coronavirus more seriously, as other artists are criticised for continuing tours

Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande are among the pop stars using their considerable clout with fans to appeal for behavioural change during the coronavirus outbreak.
Eilish delivered a five-minute Instagram story to her 57 million followers, saying: “I’ve seen a lot of young people out in the world, all over the place, going to the club or going to the beach or just going out and hanging out, and it’s really irresponsible.” She highlighted that young fans could pass it to more vulnerable relatives, and added: “Please take responsibility for your endurance of this.”
Swift spoke to her 128.2m Instagram followers to say: “I love you guys so much and need to express my concern that things aren’t being taken seriously enough right now … I’m seeing lots of get-togethers and hangs and parties still happening. This is the time to cancel plans. Don’t assume that because you don’t feel sick that you aren’t possibly passing something on to someone elderly or vulnerable to this.”
On Sunday, Grande wrote to her 72m Twitter followers: “I keep hearing from a surprising amount of people statements like ‘This isn’t a big deal’… it is incredibly selfish and dangerous to take this situation that lightly. The ‘We will be fine because we’re young’ mindset is putting people who aren’t young and/or healthy in a lot of danger. You sound stupid and privileged and you need to care more about others. Like now.”

US singer Camila Cabello said: “Especially as young people, even if we are healthy, it’s important to practice compassion and help others that could be suffering. We are in this together, let’s not be indifferent to others’ risk.” She advised her 48m Instagram followers to practise meditation to help quell any anxiety.
Their appeals come as other music stars have been criticised for going ahead with concerts during the crisis. Welsh indie band Stereophonics played a series of arena concerts over the weekend, attracting tens of thousands of fans, and defended the decision by saying: “The UK government’s position was that at this phase there was no need for a ban on large public gatherings. Acting on this guidance, we continued with the last three shows of our UK tour on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, as did many other events across the entertainment industry.”
Scottish pop singer Lewis Capaldi used the same reasoning for playing an arena concert after Scotland announced the cancellation of large-scale events but before the ban came into force.
A spokesperson said of the Scottish government’s advisory document: “The advice applies from Monday March 16, and is ‘not expected to have a significant impact on the spread of Covid-19, and this is not its purpose’, but that it aims ‘to relieve pressure on public services, including emergency services’. Security, first aid, medical and welfare teams were paid for by the organisers as normal and the venue had additional signage in place to highlight best practice on hygiene during the event.”
Tens of major tours have been cancelled, including those by Elton John, Foo Fighters and Celine Dion.
Stars are now looking to livestreaming as an alternative. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin took to Instagram Live yesterday to perform his band’s songs as well as a cover of David Bowie’s Life on Mars. “Maybe 9/11 was the last time I felt like we were all together,” he said.
The performance was part of a new initiative from the World Health Organization and Global Citizen called Together, at Home. John Legend is the next performer lined up for the series."

Issy Sampson","Being locked in a villa while a pandemic rages might sound safe. But reality contestants from Germany to Brazil are in for a huge shock – some of them on live TV


Tue 17 Mar 2020 11.54 GMT

Forget your Zoflora-scented flat or the freshly bleached kitchen table that is now your office, or even the sealed-off hospital rooms accessible only by medical professionals in hazmat suits: the two safest places in the world to hide from the coronavirus are officially the German and Canadian Big Brother houses.
The German version of the show started on 6 February, and the contestants currently have no idea that the rest of the world is living through a pandemic because, as per the rules of the show, they are not allowed any contact with the outside world. When they went into the house, no cases of coronavirus had been confirmed outside China. And, incredibly, even though new people are entering the show all the time, they are not allowed to tell the current housemates anything.
What a secret to keep! Imagine: the contestants are trying to talk them into revealing the latest football score or find out who the viewer’s favourite housemates are, and, inside, these poor reality stars-to-be are probably screaming that people are dying, and won’t they please, please wash their hands more often? The housemates will find out about the coronavirus at 7pm tonight in a special episode, where they can ask Big Brother questions such as “Are my parents OK?” and get video messages from their family. It is due to be broadcast live because, well, why would you waste the TV gold that is contestants’ hysterical tears?
The Canadian Big Brother started on 6 March – so before mass gatherings were banned in the country – and the confused housemates can’t work out why they cannot hear the audience booing them during evictions. “Maybe the house is … suddenly soundproof?” offered one contestant in a clip that has gone viral on Twitter. Which sounds stupid, until you realise that randomly guessing: “Uh, maybe a global pandemic broke out and it’s unsafe to gather in crowds,” would be even weirder. It is understood they have finally been told since the clip was released.
Big Brother Brazil’s cast are also completely unaware of coronavirus – since they entered the house on 21 January, producers have refused to update them on the outside world.
It is not like the show hasn’t been preparing for this moment. In 2013, the UK Big Brother house had a fake “viral outbreak”, in which housemates had to decide which of them got the only six gas masks or go into quarantine. The task was inspired by Charlie Brooker’s 2008 horror series Dead Set, in which Big Brother’s production staff and contestants are trapped inside the house during a zombie apocalypse. Spoiler alert: it does not end well for Davina McCall.
Clearly, it is an ethical and moral nightmare withholding information from reality show participants. On the one hand, the ignorant bliss sounds incredible. Imagine waking up every day having slept, worry-free, through the night, and then having to constantly remind yourself the reason you have to take in every breath with a gasp is merely the tight pain of anxiety in your chest, not a superbug that has killed thousands of people. Unlike the rest of the population, you don’t have to live with the dual fears of running out of loo roll or accidentally infecting the people you love the most leading to their deaths. Lovely.
But then again: if UK Big Brother is anything to go by, the house will be a hotbed of unsanitary practices; career-ruining Jacuzzi sex, fumbles under the covers lit up by night vision cameras, and long snogs in the loo because that is the only place without cameras. Yes, it is clean now, but once the house is infected – remember those new contestants sworn to secrecy? – it’ll kick off quicker than a row over the washing up.
And by not telling them, isn’t it just saying that their safety is less of a priority than ratings? It’s not like the latest series of Love Island, where contestants were not told about former host Caroline Flack’s death until after they left the villa, which made for strangely disquieting viewing.
There is a fourth Big Brother house – who knew the show was still so popular? – where the cast had no idea about the coronavirus pandemic until yesterday, when producers on Big Brother Australia made the decision to tell the housemates about the “situation”. Personally, if a killer virus was sweeping the world, I would probably want to leave and speak to my family, just in case the worst happened, instead of riding it out on live TV, eyes firmly fixed on the cash prize and Instagram followers. That’s just me, though. I’m weird like that.
But, at time of going to press, nobody has walked out of the Australian Big Brother house. Is it worth ignoring the fact that your family are at risk from a global pandemic just to have access to a house full of toilet roll and pasta? Hard to say at this time – ask us again in three weeks’ time."

Kenya Evelynin Washington","The actor and songwriter reveal on Instagram that he had emerged from a period of silent meditation to find ‘a very different world’


Tue 17 Mar 2020 17.08 GMT


The American actor and songwriter Jared Leto has just learned about the coronavirus after being isolated in the desert for almost two weeks.
The Thirty Seconds to Mars frontman made the surprising revelation over Instagram after he emerged from a silent meditation for the past 12 days. That meant he had been living completely cut off the grid, void of news and governmental updates on the deadly coronavirus outbreak which has spread across the planet.
“Wow,” his post began.
The virus has infected nearly 200,000 worldwide and more than 5,000 people in the US.
“We were totally isolated,” the actor wrote in an Instagram post. “We had no idea what was happening outside the facility.”
Leto’s reintroduction to the outside world resulted in the shocking discovery that Americans had been self-quarantining, with officials telling citizens to limit their contact with other people. His group “walked out into a very different world. One that’s been changed forever,” he said.

Leto wouldn’t be the first public figure completely unaware of an impending global pandemic. Show producers of a German version of the hit TV series Big Brother have revealed the current season’s 14 contestants are currently unaware of an outbreak of the deadly coronavirus.
As messages of well wishes and some jokes poured in, Leto reminded his followers to “stay safe” by staying inside. “Hope you and yours are ok. Sending positive energy to all,” he wrote."

New rapid Covid-19 testing kit can return results in 15 minutes but not yet available in Australia

Tue 17 Mar 2020 16.30 GMT


Last modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 02.44 GMT


The federal health department says it sees “merit” in a newly developed rapid Covid-19 testing kit able to return results within 15 minutes, which experts say could help relieve significant pressure on pathology services.
Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has warned the country faces “extreme pressure” supplying enough testing kits as the rate of infection continues to skyrocket, warning last week that the number of pathology testing kits, reagents and swabs was “deteriorating rapidly” with some regions now completely out of supplies.
The government has so far refused to say how many testing kits remain in the country, although the health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Tuesday the supply was “sufficient for current requirements”.
As the virus spread in Wuhan, Chinese researchers developed a more rapid “point of care” screening test, which detects antibodies that emerge some time after Covid-19 symptoms appear. A study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology said the test could return results within 15 minutes, much faster than the current standard testing.
The test – known as the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit – is not currently in use in Australia, but the Guardian understands some companies are seeking to supply it onto the market.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the rapid test had “merit” and that there were “no compelling reasons not to use it based on the described science and methodology”.
But she said the company behind it, the Nantong Egens Biotechnology Company Ltd, had not yet approached the regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for assessment and approval.
Such a device would need to be approved through the TGA’s in-vitro diagnostics regulatory scheme before use, the department said.
The company has had the test validated by laboratories in Europe and China. But the spokeswoman said the same would need to occur in Australia.
“Tests also require validation by testing laboratories in the Australian context before use,” she said.
“The Department of Health, in collaboration with the Public Health Laboratory Network, is monitoring the development of test kits and methodologies and their performance as they are used more widely around the world.”
In Australia, a company called COVID-19 Rapid is representing three manufacturers seeking to get TGA approval for the rapid tests. A company spokesman said: “Our TGA consultants have told us that unlike the US and Europe, securing approval will take too long and be very expensive.”
Experts approached by the Guardian said the testing had potential benefits and drawbacks. The testing does not require a laboratory, which could help alleviate pressure on Australia’s pathology services and the rest of the health system.
Peter White, a virologist from the University of New South Wales, said if it were possible for rapid tests to be used by people at home it would help take the burden off an already strained health system.
“These tests will be useful for sure, they could keep infected people out of the health system and they do also provide peace of mind,” he said.
“There are certainly some advantages. If someone thinks they have the virus and can do the test at home in 15 minutes that’s someone who isn’t presenting at a hospital, GP or pathology lab.
“Even if you received a false positive, if you were able to take the precaution of having it backed up with [a traditional test] it would be good. If people received a negative result, they might be less inclined to visit the clinic which is going to free up hospital resources.”
But, he stressed, the tests were not always as reliable as those currently being used in Australia. Because rapid test kits look for antibodies associated with the virus rather than the virus itself, they could record false-negatives if used at the wrong time.
“The question is how significant those limitations are. It depends really on how many true cases you detect. Does it detect every positive, or does it miss 5%?” he said
“Because if you have to back up every test with a lab pathology test it might defeat the purpose a little bit.”
Bill Bowtell, an infectious diseases expert from the Kirby Institute, said while there was no shortage of medical supply companies looking to profit off the Covid-19 crisis, the TGA would need to consider the kits closely.
“In the end, anybody with anything to sell is in the market and their interest is to make the biggest claims,” he said.
“I think that’s the case with a lot of the things that we’ll see coming onto the market. There’s uncertainty because it didn’t come to market after stringent testing, it came to the market because there’s a feeling of ‘my god we need it’.
“In normal circumstances you wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole but this is what happens when there’s a crisis.”"

Government urges Australians overseas to return home as borders close around the world

Katharine Murphy","Advice comes as new social distancing measures are set to be unveiled after a meeting between Scott Morrison and the premiers on Tuesday night

The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Australians to return home as soon as possible by commercial means because overseas travel is becoming “more complex and difficult” as countries impose travel restrictions and close their borders.
The new travel advice, issued on Tuesday night, triggered speculation that the Morrison government could be about to impose a lockdown in Australia. But officials told Guardian Australia that was not in contemplation.
Governments are poised to unveil new social distancing measures after a meeting between Scott Morrison and the premiers on Tuesday night. Leaders discussed additional restrictions on indoor gatherings and new measures for the aged care sector and remote Indigenous communities.
As well as the efforts to slow community transmissions of the illness, the Morrison government is also preparing a second multibillion-dollar “safety net” package. The Coalition is considering a boost to income support for welfare recipients and support for businesses at risk as a consequence of economic shock associated with the coronavirus.
While a second round of pump priming is being prepared, senior ministers on Tuesday warned the extra spending will not be enough to avoid widespread job losses stemming from the Covid-19 health crisis.
The health minister, Greg Hunt, on Tuesday also flagged a massive scaling up of public testing for the disease amid concern over test kit shortages, saying he will make a “major announcement” on the country’s testing regime on Wednesday.
According to the Department of Health, the global shortage of test kits is the reason behind the government’s decision to undertake targeted, rather than widespread testing.
The new Dfat travel advice asks Australians to reassess all overseas travel if it is non-essential, and it says: “If you’re already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means”.
Given more and more countries are closing their borders or introducing travel restrictions, Dfat advised people may not be able to return to Australia when they need to. “If you decide to return to Australia, do so as soon as possible. Commercial options may become less available,” Dfat said.
The department said the advice had been adjusted because there may be a higher risk of contracting the virus overseas and “you may come in contact with more people than usual, including during long-haul flights and in crowded airports”. It says health systems in some countries “may come under strain and may not be as well-equipped as Australia’s or have the capacity to support foreigners”.
“Overseas travel has become more complex and unpredictable. Many countries are introducing entry or movement restrictions. These are changing often and quickly. Your travel plans may be disrupted. You may be placed in quarantine or denied entry to some countries, and you may need to self-quarantine on return to Australia”.
“Think about what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities”.
As of Tuesday, there are 438 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia, with a third federal politician – the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg – among the latest to test positive to the disease.
Three senators who attended a committee hearing with Bragg last week – Jenny McAllister, Tony Sheldon and Rex Patrick – are now in self-isolation.
The rapidly escalating crisis has prompted the Coalition to hastily develop another wave of economic stimulus, which is expected to be more far-reaching than the $17.6bn package announced last week.
Federal cabinet discussed options in a meeting on Tuesday, with the measures also discussed by the cabinet’s expenditure review committee, however it is understood no final decisions have been made.
The government is looking at ways to ramp up support through existing programs and mechanisms, but the package is unlikely to be announced until after the Reserve Bank of Australia intervenes again on Thursday either through another emergency rate cut or a significant purchase of government bonds.
It is expected the government will put the new measures to a scaled-down parliament next week to be voted on before the Easter break and the May budget.
It is possible the government will also a deliver a separate assistance package for airlines in advance of unveiling the second round of stimulus either at the weekend or early next week. Qantas has signalled it will close 90% of international flights and 60% of domestic flights from the end of the month.
The government and the opposition have agreed that only 90 of the country’s 151 MPs will come to Canberra for the next parliamentary session, along with 54 of the country’s 76 senators.
The package is expected to target both heavily affected industries as well as vulnerable low-income earners.
However, even with the extra billions of dollars in government support, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, warned that the “grim reality” was that jobs would be lost as the country faced an “unprecedented” economic shutdown.
“We are very conscious that as we are looking at things today, that many businesses will close and many Australians will lose their jobs,” Cormann said on Tuesday.
“We will ensure that they have got the appropriate levels of support through this transition to the other side when there will be a strong bounce back and a strong recovery.”
The finance minister also revealed that the government was looking at specific measures to help vulnerable low-income earners, who he conceded would be hard hit by a downturn.
“We are very seriously considering what appropriate supports we can provide, in particular to the most vulnerable across our community and specifically those that are most severely impacted,” Cormann said.
“This is going to be a tough period. There will be a strong recovery on the other side, but it is going to be a tough period. We are all in this together. We are going to come up with the best possible way to get ourselves through this period.”
Amid calls for the government to do more to protect casual workers, the minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said the existing social safety net was the best delivery mechanism “for those who will need help in the challenging times ahead”.
“But however many people may require help in the challenging times ahead, because they find they are not able to work or because they have experienced unemployment due to changed economic conditions, the best assistance mechanism is the welfare system because of its proven ability to deliver income support to affected workers,” Porter told Guardian Australia.
“This is the most effective way to ensure income support reaches those in need as simply and quickly as possible, with regular waiting periods waived.”
Porter said that while the government was not considering “wholesale structural change” to the industrial relations system, those most affected needed “income support until things improve”.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, called on the government to offer more support for anyone in the workforce who has to self-isolate without access to an income – including both employees and small business people.
“Many businesses are paying to cover periods in isolation, even where there is no legal obligation to do so,” Pearson said.
“But small, family-owned businesses struggling to survive, let alone retain the staff they have, do not have the resources to support additional payments for casuals.”"

Melissa Davey","Doctors send letter to health minister saying schools and public places should be closed, but experts warn public panic could force politicians to make bad decisions


Tue 17 Mar 2020 04.29 GMT


Last modified on Tue 17 Mar 2020 06.32 GMT


Almost 2,500 doctors have urged the health minister, Greg Hunt, to take immediate action on containment measures around the country to curb coronavirus.
Led by Dr Hemant Garg, the letter states doctors are “dismayed at the disconnect between the actions being taken within the medical community and the recommendation for actions being passed on to the general population”.
“We should immediately recommend a three to four week closure of schools, cultural and religious places including places of worship, gyms and leisure centres, pubs, bars, theatres, cinemas and concert halls,” the letter states. “This would allow a steady declaration of cases of coronavirus to present to hospitals and fever clinics as their symptomatic phase develops.”
On social media many doctors and members of the public are also calling for immediate school closures and shutdowns. A separate letter, led by an intensive care specialist in Sydney and directed to the prime minister, calls for an immediate lockdown of Australia.
“Many of us are in contact with colleagues in Italy, Spain and France and they are begging us to learn from their mistakes,” the letter states.
“With access to intensive care the death rate from COVID19 is likely less than 1%, but in an overwhelmed system without access to intensive care the death rate approaches 4%.”
On Tuesday Hunt said while school closures had not been ruled out, “mass school closures would impact significantly on critical emergency service workers, on health workers, as well as exposing young people potentially to being with grandparents on a much more broader basis”.
Prof Julie Leask, from the University of Sydney’s faculty of health and medicine, said pressure should not dissuade the federal government from following advice from the key decision-making committee for health emergencies, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.
She said because of public panic and fear she is “concerned the pressure will be so high on politicians to adopt a strategy that doesn’t have a good evidence base, and that they may overrule the measures the Committee are advising”.
The current national advice is to get tested if you:
The national coronavirus health information hotline is 1800 020 080.The federal health department has a coronavirus health alert website. 
The state health department websites and contact numbers are:
“There’s a real risk of that,” she said. “[Former labor party leader] Bill Shorten deciding to remove his children from schools is a personal decision but by making it public it sends a signal to the wider community that it’s something that should be done, when the advice right now is not to do that. We are in a precarious time. But it’s not like the government is sitting on its hands.”
However, Leask said the views of the doctors should be listened to by the federal government.
“They are facing a very large demand on health care services and it’s clearly filling them with dread, the idea of an Italy-type situation where they have to make decisions about who gets the ventilator and who doesn’t. What strategies are taken now to flatten the curve are essential,” she said.
“This is a very tense time and people are angry and scared. But the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee recommendations are being informed by careful modelling of infection spread balanced against unintended consequences of something like closing schools.
“That expertise needs to be respected in the same way you might respect your neurology colleague in terms of how to treat someone with delirium.”
Leask said to quell public panic the federal government needed to do “a much better job” at communicating the reasons behind their decisions.
A communique issued by the Australian Medical Association federal council on Tuesday agreed, stating “consistent, succinct and contemporaneous communication across all media from a single trusted source must be provided” to the public.
“Public education on effective and sensitive public distancing measures should focus on individual as well as institutional responsibilities,” the AMA said. “Planning should be undertaken for potential advanced education centre closures, workplace restrictions, and the possibility of school closures.”
Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, issued a statement explaining why closing schools doesn’t necessarily help flatten the curve. He said research shows the potential reduction in community transmission from pre-emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements for children not at school.
The infectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist Prof Lyn Gilbert said there was still limited community transmission of the virus in Australia. She said while stopping large public gatherings, testing and tracing measures and hygiene messaging had assisted with this, modelling data shows blanket closure of schools has little effect on transmission.
“People are getting quite excited about the idea of shutting everything down suddenly,” she said. “You can’t easily keep that going for any length of time unless you do it with sensible justification and gradually. People will tolerate it for a couple of weeks but not a long time without justification. People must be considered about how it’s done and use evidence and do it gradually, and that’s happening at the moment. There will be progressive announcements.”
It was also important that Australia had acted much more swiftly than Italy, Gilbert said.
“We just have to be patient and not give in to the panicked demands of people saying shut it all down,” she said. “I’ve seen people saying shut everything down for 18 months until we have a vaccine, but there is no guarantee we will have one.”"

Luke Henriques-Gomes","Survey reveals that 82% of families haven’t been able to buy supplies they need amid coronavirus outbreak

People with disabilities have had their national disability insurance scheme and other support services cancelled and been unable to get essential medication and supplies during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey by peak bodies in the sector.
A survey of 200 families conducted by Children and Young People with Disability Australia and the Australian Coalition for Inclusive Education also reveals concern about a lack of clear official advice for people with disabilities during the crisis.
Of the families with children and young people with disabilities surveyed, 82% of had not been able to buy essential supplies, 34% had NDIS or other support services cancelled and 15% were unable to buy the medication they needed.
An overwhelming majority (86%) said they were not receiving the information they needed to “keep children or young people with disability safe during the crisis”.
Mary Sayers, the chief executive of Children and Young People with Disability Australia, told Guardian Australia the government’s urgent priority should be ensuring an adequate supply of essential medicines and other supplies for children with disabilities, as well as personal protective equipment for carers.
She said disability service organisations were facing “enormous trouble with workers not turning up” and that parents and children were having support services cancelled at short notice.
One parent had told the survey their six-year-old child had lost 3kg during the crisis after a hospital appointment was cancelled.
Respondents to the survey said they were frustrated by mixed messages from education systems across the country about how social distancing would affect student support services.
Parents of children with disabilities were unsure whether to send their kids to school, where they may continue to share drinking taps and play closely with other children, she said.
Sue Tape’s daughter Eliza has Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a physical and intellectual disability that also means “respiratory bugs can really knock her about”.
Tape said there had been a “distinct lack” of clear information and advice.
“We’ve decided to self-isolate both our kids at home this week as a pre-emptive measure because there haven’t been some hard decisions made by other people,” she said.
“I can’t see any planning beyond the decisions we are personally making. By rights, both my kids could still be at school, I could still be getting on public transport and going to work.”
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”
The health department recommends practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene as the best defence against most viruses.
 It also advises regular cleaning of household surfaces.
 “To minimise the spread of any germs you should regularly wash surfaces that are frequently touched such as door handles, light switches, kitchen and bathroom areas. Clean with household detergent or disinfectant.

“In the absence of information, we have to make these decisions. That is very stressful. And there are other families that don’t get to make that decision because they have to go to work.”
The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, said the government had plans in place to support NDIS participants, providers and the NDIA and “to ensure continuation of services in the case of an escalation in the incidence of Covid-19”.
“NDIS participants, families, carers and providers will be given clear direction if services are disrupted in any way, ensuring they have options to continue accessing supports,” he said.
Robert said he would meet NDIS stakeholders over the coming days “in preparation of escalation of incidence of Covid-19”.
“I am working closely with my cabinet colleagues, departments and agencies to support a coordinated approach to delivering essential services such as the NDIS to the community.”
A group of disability researchers from the universities of Melbourne, Sydney and New South Wales on Friday released a series of recommendations for the government to develop a specific response for people with disabilities during the coronavirus outbreak.
It included a call to rapidly increase the healthcare sector’s capacity to care for people with disabilities and the disability care workforce so services would remain open for those who need them.
The Disability Reform Council, which oversees the NDIS, will meet on Wednesday."

Luke Henriques-Gomes","Calls for suspension of demand that welfare recipients meet employment agencies

A national organisation representing Australia’s welfare recipients has called on the government to suspend mutual obligations to prevent people having their payments suspended during the coronavirus crisis.
Under normal circumstances, people who receive payments such as Newstart must record their job searches online and attend meetings with employment services agencies to avoid having their income support cut off.
The government has said people forced into isolation according to the official health advice can access a 14-day personal crisis exemption before they require a medical certificate.
Yet there are fears that others who do not officially need to self-isolate but are unable to meet their obligations due to the unfolding pandemic may have their payments suspended.
Guardian Australia has spoken to a woman with a compromised immune system who was told she would still need to attend an appointment with an employment services provider despite her condition.
Jeremy Poxon, an Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union spokesman, said the organisation had written to the government to ask that it suspend mutual obligations for jobseekers across the country.
The Australian government announced new travel restrictions to try to slow the spread of coronavirus on 15 March. From midnight, all returning Australians and overseas visitors are required to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in the country.
People who have been in close contact with somebody diagnosed coronavirus are already required to self-isolate.
Self-isolation starts when you arrive in Australia, with the federal department of health recommending you use personal transport, such as a car, to travel home or to your hotel from the airport, to minimise exposure to others.
 “If you need to use public transport (e.g. taxis, ride-hail services, trains, buses and trams), follow the precautions outlined in the public transport guide. 
 “During the 14 days of isolation, you must stay at home or in your hotel and don’t go to public places including work, school, childcare, university or public gatherings. Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.”
 “Ask others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don’t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.”
 “If you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.”
The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including “fever, cough or shortness of breath. Other early symptoms include chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose and muscle pain.”
 “If you develop symptoms (fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness or shortness of breath) within 14 days of returning to Australia or within 14 days of last contact of a confirmed case, you should arrange to see your doctor for urgent assessment. You should telephone the health clinic or hospital before you arrive and tell them your travel history or that you may have been in contact with a potential case of coronavirus.”

Poxon said it would be impossible for some people to meet obligations – such as recording their job searches online – in areas where public libraries and other facilities were being closed.
“If they don’t suspend mutual obligations, people will be penalised and cut off in the middle of this crisis,” he said.
Research shows that Newstart recipients are more likely to suffer from poor health, while government data shows about 40% of people on Newstart have a partial capacity to work, meaning Centrelink acknowledges that they cannot work full-time due to an illness or disability.
Among them is Vanessa, a Newstart recipient who said she was told by her disability employment agency on Friday that she would still need to attend an appointment.
Vanessa, who did not want her surname used, said she had undergone chemotherapy over a significant period of time and was now required to take an immunosuppressant for the rest of her life.
She is avoiding leaving the house to keep herself safe but would need to take a tram to get to the job services provider. “My appointment is next Wednesday and I have to go,” she said. “If I don’t go, I don’t get money.”
Current government advice states that only those who are exhibiting symptoms, those who have returned from overseas, and people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case must self-isolate.
In a fact sheet published on Monday afternoon, the Department of Education, Skills and Employment said people were required to keep attending appointments unless they needed to self-isolate in line with the official advice from the health department.
Asked if the government was considering suspending mutual obligations, a department spokeswoman said employment service providers were being “encouraged to be responsive and [flexible] during this challenging time”.
She said it was “recommended” providers use the “online portal and phone to negotiate alternative job-seeking activities where appropriate with jobseekers”.
The spokeswoman said jobseekers with concerns should contact their provider or the National Customer Service Line.
“The Department will continue to monitor this situation closely and will review this advice as needed, in line with direction from the Department of Health,” she said.
Vanessa believed the current arrangements precluded her from getting an exemption. Her provider is aware of her health issues and concerns but was told her appointment was going ahead.
“I don’t have the virus, nor have I come into contact with someone who has,” she said. “I am, however, in a category of being more susceptible by being immuno-compromised. It is my understanding that I don’t fit the current rules for not attending the appointment.”
The Government needs to confirm what is going on with mutual obligations. I am very worried about people falling through the cracks and not getting their payments during this time.#Auspol #Centrelink #COVIDー19 https://t.co/CSVt981pzQ
Also on Monday, Centrelink said it had fixed an technical glitch that told welfare recipients their next payment would be cut in half.
Messages sent to Guardian Australia show payments due after 20 March, when the government will create the new jobseeker payment, were set at about half the normal rate.
Alice Eldridge, who receives Newstart, told Guardian Australia that the glitch was “extremely distressing” and had made the coronavirus crisis even “scarier” for people surviving on low incomes.
“I spent all of yesterday in a downward spiral because I was panicking about how I could pay my rent, bills, food or medications in the next two weeks, and wondering if I’ll be out on the street with the rest of the homeless population that are being forgotten during this pandemic,” she said.
In a statement on Twitter, Centrelink said at midday on Monday: “We’re aware some people’s future payments weren’t displaying correctly over the weekend. This has since been fixed. We apologise for any confusion or concern this caused.”
It came as the government pushes ahead with an overhaul to payments such as Newstart, youth allowance and sickness allowance, which from 20 March will be rolled into the jobseeker payment. The government has stressed that the eligibility requirements will remain the same and no one will receive a lower payment due to the administrative change.
The Greens senator Rachel Siewert has called on the government to postpone the change, citing confusion during the coronavirus crisis.
Hank Jongen, a Services Australia spokesman, said the issue was due to a “routine update separate to jobseeker payment and we fixed this in a matter of hours”.
“It won’t affect the introduction of jobseeker payment,” he said."

Christopher Knaus","Australia has faced pressure on its ability to test for Covid-19 due to ‘unprecedented’ demand on laboratories


Mon 16 Mar 2020 08.41 GMT


Last modified on Tue 17 Mar 2020 04.57 GMT


One of the world’s biggest suppliers of coronavirus tests is about to rush new equipment onto the Australian market that can deliver results within three hours.
Australia, like many nations across the globe, is facing some pressure on its ability to test for coronavirus due to what health authorities say is “unprecedented” demand on laboratories.
Roche, a multinational medical device company, says it has rushed to develop a new test to support “the urgent need for patient testing during the novel coronavirus pandemic”.
Roche says results can be returned within three hours of testing. That allows for 384 tests in an eight-hour shift.
The process, known as the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, was rushed onto the market using emergency authorisations provided by medical device regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration and Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration.
The new testing kits are expected to begin arriving in Australia by Wednesday. Together with an older test already in use, known as the MagNA Pure 96, Roche says this will inject 100,000 new testing kits into Australian laboratories.
“The demand for Covid-19 tests in Australia is unprecedented and our teams have been working relentlessly to meet demands,” the company said on Monday.
“Roche will be reordering both test kits frequently, based on Australian patient needs. We will continue to have both tests available in Australia, to ensure maximum coverage and patient reach.
“We are continuing to work with Australian laboratories and the federal government to ensure locations of greatest need are prioritised and people at the highest risk of Covid-19 have access to these tests.”
The Australian Medical Association on Monday warned that variable supply of a standard reagent was contributing to pressures on testing capacity in some states and territories. The reagent, a chemical substance used to extract nucleic acid from samples, is critical to the testing process.
A lack of reagent has also contributed to the poor testing capacity in the United States, and the Food and Drug Administration has said it is working across the clock to resolve the issue.
Last week, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said supply issues affecting testing were “temporary” and were being urgently addressed.
“It’s a temporary issue, but it relates to the fact that a number of countries where these consumables are made have probably put export controls over them to keep them for their own use,” he said. “We will work through it. We’ve got world-leading medical technology and will fix that issue, but it has caused a temporary issue with the scale of the testing that we can do at the moment.”
On Monday, the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the issue was not with testing kits, but with “consumables”. Kelly also said it was temporary and would be addressed with urgency.
Roche said in its statement it has been working day and night to boost supply of testing kits.
“Globally, we are going to the limits of our production capacity to make sure large quantities of tests are available for countries most in need,” the statement said.
“Appropriate testing is absolutely key during this uncertain time.”"

More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists are trapped on board a cruise ship that is currently stuck off the coast of Chile after the country banned cruise ships from docking in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Roald Amundsen, owned by cruise company Hurtigruten, is one of several stranded off the Chilean port of Punta Arenas, and has a capacity of less than 500 passengers.
Chile has banned cruise vessels from docking until September after an elderly passenger on one cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus.
The country’s health minister, Jaime Mañalich announced the ban on Twitter on Sunday.
Hemos decidido prohibir la recalada en todo puerto chileno de cruceros a partir de las 8:00 de mañana domingo. Se implementará por DIRECTMAR. https://t.co/pxDkVjmHYf
Guardian Australian has confirmed more than 100 doctors, dentists and medical experts from Australia were on board for a 10-night cruise to Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and the Chilean Fjords as part of a combined medical and dental conference put on by Unconventional Conventions.
Speakers at the event include Prof Gordian Fulde AO, Dr Glenn Rice-McDonald and associate professor Peter S Hamblin, according to the guide for the conference. The convention host is an accredited education provider with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.
The cruise departed on 29 February, and was due to return on Tuesday, docking at the port the ship is currently blocked from docking.
The ship’s live cam shows the vessel sitting stationary off the coast.
The cruise company, Hurtigruten said it was working with the Chilean government, local authorities, embassies, airports and airlines to arrange disembarkation as soon as possible.
“Our passengers and crew are our top priority and all are well. Our task force’s focus is to get all passengers home as quickly and safely as possible and we are regularly updating our passengers on board with our plans to get them home,” says Damian Perry, managing director of Hurtigruten Asia Pacific.
The company said guests were in good spirits and there have been no cases of coronavirus on board.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was aware of the situation and was ready to provide consular assistance.
Guardian Australia has sought comment from the conference organisers.
A Sacramento lawyer, Bill Portanova, on the ship with his wife told the Sacramento Bee that the captain had been trying to negotiate to land somewhere for days.
“We’re offshore and, apparently, the story we got is that they worked something out where we would be taken to the port, health-screened, removed from the ship with masks and gloves directly into buses and straight to the airport,” Portanova said.
“But some locals got wind of the plan and there was some kind of a protest, so the deal fell through.”
The ship launched last year, and has three restaurants, a gym and wellness centre, an infinity pool and hot tubs.
Celebrity Eclipse, a ship with a capacity of close to 3,000, has also been refused docking in Chile since the ban, BuzzFeed News reported.
Chile had reported 155 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Monday, when president Sebastián Piñera announced Chile would close its borders to foreigners from Wednesday.
Other countries to ban cruise ships docking include Australia, Colombia, Greece, Italy, Montanegro and Portugal.
Several cruise companies have decided to suspend cruises for the near future."

New York coronavirus cases jump to 1,374 as governor urges ‘compassion and cooperation’

Amanda Holpuch in New York
New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the latest projections showed his state’s coronavirus cases could peak in 45 days’ time, after announcing on Tuesday that the state’s total number of cases had jumped to 1,374.
New York has the highest number of known cases of any US state, but Cuomo said it was too early to advise people to shelter in place, as people in parts of California were ordered to do on Monday.
“It is a frightening time on every level,” Cuomo said at a press conference, explaining that the outbreak was a crisis but not a permanent one.
“Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling – but we will get through this much time,” Cuomo said. “Be a little bit more sensitive. Understand the stress, understand the fear, be a little bit more loving, a little bit more compassionate, a little bit more comforting, a little bit more cooperative, and we will get through this time.”
The governor announced 432 new coronavirus cases in New York, where 12 people have died from the respiratory illness. There are more than 4,000 cases across the US and 71 confirmed deaths.
Like the rest of the US, New York is working to curb the spread of coronavirus because of fears a rapid increase in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system. To stop the spread, people are advised to limit interactions with others and to take basic health precautions such as frequent handwashing.
Cuomo emphasized the 45-day estimate was a “projection” which should be taken with a “little grain of salt”. He said the focus was on minimizing the impact of coronavirus on senior citizens and people with compromised immune systems or underlying illness in a state that is home to 19.5 million people.
If the state’s peak projection is correct, Cuomo said it estimates a need for 55,000 to 110,000 hospital beds and 18,600 to 37,200 intensive care (ICU) beds. The state has 53,000 hospital beds and 3,000 ICU beds.
To slow the spread of coronavirus, New York has closed schools for two weeks. It has also ordered restaurants to only make food for takeout and delivery and for bars and gyms to close. With New Jersey and Connecticut, New York has also banned gatherings of more than 50 people.
Cuomo said it was unlikely there would need to be domestic travel restrictions in New York.
“We have the highest number of cases in the country, I don’t think we have a lot of people wanting to come this way,” he said.
Cuomo said he would not yet order people to shelter in place in part because such a dramatic decision would need to be made in a uniform fashion. It would not be helpful, he said, if there was a shelter in place in New York City or the state capital, Albany, because it could drive large groups of people to leave.
“No city in the state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city,” Cuomo said.
The state would use other measures to reduce transmission, he said, such as a greater reduction in business operations, before it would need to advise a regional quarantine.
On the opposite side of the country, however, people in the Bay Area of California were waking up to the first day of a shelter in place order which advised about 7 million people to stay inside their homes unless it is absolutely necessary to leave.
It is a drastic move similar to ones taken in Italy, Spain and China, the first of its kind in the US.
“The time now is not to panic,” San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, said in a news conference. “It’s for us to come together. It’s for us to follow the directives. It’s to do everything in our respective capacities to prevent the spread of coronavirus so we can get past this very challenging time.”
Several other states have ordered businesses to close or limit service, including Colorado, Michigan, Maryland, Kentucky, Louisiana and Indiana.
Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, on Monday ordered restaurants to only provide takeout, drive-thru and delivery service through the end of March and ordered gyms and movie theaters to close. There are 54 confirmed cases in the state.
“My number one priority remains to protect the most people we can from the spread of coronavirus,” Whitmer said in a statement. “We are all better off when all of us are healthy, and that’s especially true for the most vulnerable. These aggressive actions are aimed at saving lives.”"

Caroline Davies","Duke and Duchess of Sussex take ‘measures’ as monarch cancels garden parties


Tue 17 Mar 2020 16.04 GMT


First published on Tue 17 Mar 2020 14.42 GMT


The Queen will decamp to Windsor Castle, cancel her traditional garden parties and postpone investitures as the threat of coronavirus triggers a wholesale ripping up of the royal diaries for all members of her family.
Buckingham Palace announced that the monarch, who will be 94 next month, would be leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday.
“Her Majesty will move to Windsor Castle for the Easter period on Thursday 19 March, one week earlier than planned. It is likely the Queen will stay there beyond the Easter period,” it said.
The precautionary measures follow the government’s announcement that the spread of coronavirus in London is thought to be some weeks ahead of the rest of UK.
Officials are concerned for the welfare of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, who since retiring spends his time on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be taking “appropriate measures” over coronavirus after suggestions that Prince Harry could have been exposed to it during his final UK engagements this month.
Harry hugged Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton as the two opened the Silverstone Experience Centre on 6 March.
Two days before, Hamilton was photographed at the WE Day UK charity events in London alongside the actor Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister – both of whom have since tested positive for Covid-19.
The Queen has already cancelled planned engagements in Cheshire and Camden as a “sensible precaution” because of her propensity to attract crowds, and to prevent any drain on over-stretched services required to host such public events.
Following consultation between her medical household and the government, other events pencilled in for “the coming months” are also now being cancelled as part of unprecedented peacetime measures to try and control the spread of the virus. These include the Maundy service at St George’s chapel on 9 April.
“Three garden parties hosted by the Queen, due to be held at Buckingham Palace in May, will not now take place,” a Buckingham Palace spokesman said.
“Guests already invited to these garden parties will be asked to attend in 2021.
“Two additional garden parties given for the Not Forgotten Association and the National Trust will also not take place.” A decision is yet to be made on the annual garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.
The cancellation of the Queen’s garden parties is thought to be unprecedented. Palace officials could not recall a similar occasion in recent memory.
Trooping the Colour, one of the annual highlights of the royal calendar and one of the family events which the Prince Harry and Meghan were expected to attend, is also in doubt, as is the 75th anniversary of VE Day and the state visit by the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Further announcements on these “will be made in due course in consultation with the government”.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on whether Harry and Meghan were self-isolating at their Vancouver Island retreat. One source said that the couple, like everyone, would be taking “appropriate measures and following government advice”. Should they be made aware of being in contact with someone who has tested positive, they would act accordingly. 
Trudeau announced last week that she had put herself in quarantine, having been tested after experiencing mild symptoms on her return from London.
Elba revealed on Monday he had tested positive via a video on Twitter, in which he said he felt OK and that he had no symptoms but had decided to self-isolate. The Luther actor said he only got tested after coming into contact with someone who later confirmed they had coronavirus, but did not give details of who that person was.
Hamilton has urged fans to take coronavirus seriously, and has posted a video showing how to hand-wash on his Twitter account. It is not known if he has been tested for the virus.
Harry flew back to Canada just before Justin Trudeau announced the closure of Canada’s borders to stop the spread. Trudeau has urged Canadians to stay at home “as much as possible”."

Trump says 'keep politics out' of coronavirus then picks fight with Democrats

David Smith in Washington
Donald Trump picked fights with Democrats on Tuesday even as he called for them to “keep politics out” of the battle against what he called, in a return to nationalist rhetoric, “the Chinese virus”.
As the White House prepares a massive stimulus package to counter the effect of the Covid-19 outbreak, the president gave an upbeat assessment of the economy, seen as critical to his political future, promising it would “pop” again soon.
“We’re going to win,” he vowed.
That this crisis is taking place in an election year is impossible to ignore.
“I watched the debate – not too exciting,” Trump said of last Sunday’s meeting between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. “But what they said about me – and we’ve done a great job – when you talk about not being bipartisan, what they said about me.”
He accused the Obama administration, in which Biden was vice-president, of making “terrible” and “horrific” mistakes in handling a swine flu outbreak in 2009.
“Seventeen thousand people died,” Trump told reporters at a coronavirus taskforce briefing. In fact the official death toll in the US was 12,469.
“They shouldn’t be criticising because we’ve done a fantastic job,” Trump added, before airing a familiar grievance.
“The only thing we haven’t done well is to get good press. We’ve done a fantastic job but it hasn’t been appreciated.
“Even the closing down of the borders, which had never been done, and not only did we close them but we closed them early. The press doesn’t like writing about it. So we’ve done a poor job on press relationships and I guess I don’t know who to blame for that. I don’t know, maybe I can blame ourselves for that. I will blame ourselves.”
In a rare Oval Office address last week, Trump urged unity. But almost every day since he has attacked Obama, Biden or Democratic governors. He began Tuesday by going after governors Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.
He tweeted: “Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.”
Trump added: “Andrew, keep politics out of it …”
New York is now among the worst affected by the coronavirus. But at a press conference in Albany, Cuomo struck a conciliatory tone: “I said to the president, who is a New Yorker … ‘I put my hand out in partnership. I want to work together 100%. I want your help. I need your help.
“I think the president was 100% sincere in saying he wanted to work together in partnership, in a spirt of cooperation. The actions he has taken evidence that. His team are on it.”
Trump also attacked Whitmer, seen as a potential running mate for Biden.
“Failing Michigan governor must work harder and be much more proactive,” he wrote. “We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!”
Whitmer shot back, seeking “swift and clear guidance, tests, personal protective equipment, and resources”. She went on to list measures taken in her state, a key election battleground.
At the White House, Trump insisted: “I only do that when I have to respond. I watched her [Whitmer] on television. She said something that was false and therefore I did do that and I will continue to do that.
“If they’re not going to play fair, because you know, they have the media on their side. I don’t. I just have me. And if they’re not going to play fair, I’m going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there’s going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of bipartisanship.”
Trump also faced criticism for his use of the phrase “Chinese virus”. Congressman Ted Lieu tweeted: “There’s a difference between saying a virus came from China versus calling it a Chinese virus. Asian Americans have already been assaulted because of this type of rhetoric.”
Asked by the Guardian if he intended to continue using the phrase, Trump replied: “China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false and rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China so I think it’s a very accurate term.”
More than a month ago, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the novel strain of the coronavirus had an official name, Covid-19, which should “prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing”.
A robust economy had been seen as Trump’s strongest suit for re-election. Now he faces recession. Airlines are said to face a bigger crisis than after 9/11.
Trump insisted: “If we do this right, our country can be rolling again pretty quickly. We have to fight that invisible enemy. I guess, unknown – but we’re getting to know it a lot better.”
He added: “The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that’s gone, it’s going to pop back like nobody’s ever seen before, that’s my opinion … I think our economy will come back really rapidly. One day we’ll be standing possibly up here, we’ll say, ‘Well, we won.’ Sure as you’re sitting here, we’re going to say that. We’re going to win.”
Trump has claimed credit for banning travel from China early on but faced condemnation for not moving faster on widespread testing. Despite a long list of public statements in which he downplayed the threat, on Tuesday he made a startling claim: “I’ve always known this is a real – this is a pandemic.
“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”"

Coronavirus fears and controversial passport sales: Vanuatu's election explained
",Tess Newton Cain,"A country with fractured and shifting political alliances, Vanuatu heads to the polls at a crucial moment in its history

In the coffee shops and kava bars of Vanuatu’s capital of Port Vila, there are two subjects that dominate conversation: Covid-19 and this week’s general elections, which will be held on Thursday.
Vanuatu, a south Pacific nation just a three-hour flight from Australia, has a population of just under 300,000. It is often thought of as a politically unstable nation, with shifting political allegiances, seemingly based more on expediency than ideology.
In 2015, 14 members of parliament, including the acting prime minister, were found guilty of corruption, putting half the governing party’s MPs behind bars. The last elections were held in January 2016 and there has been one prime minister, Charlot Salwai, since then.
The 2020 elections come at a key time for Vanuatu, which this year marks its 40th anniversary of independence from joint rule by France and the United Kingdom. It is also scheduled to host the next meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders – the most significant regional diplomatic event – in August, and is scheduled to graduate from “least-developed” status by the end of the year.
From a field of almost 240 candidates, the people of Vanuatu will elect 52 MPs to sit in parliament. The prime minister will be elected by the entire house when it sits later this year.
Vanuatu politics is fractured and complex. After the 2016 elections there were 17 parties represented in the parliament, but none of them secured more than six seats and coalition governments have been a feature of the Vanuatu political scene for quite some time and that is unlikely to change this year.
While long-established parties such as the Vanua’aku Pati (VP) and the United Moderates Party (UMP) will no doubt have a presence in the new parliament, newer groupings such as Salwai’s Reunification Movement for Change (RMC) and the Leaders Party of Vanuatu, led by the outgoing deputy prime minister Jotham Napat, are expected to feature strongly.
The profile of political candidates in Vanuatu has evolved over the years. Back in 1980, when Father Walter Lini became the first prime minister, the political leadership was largely made up of pastors and senior members of churches.
Now, Vanuatu’s parliament is increasingly a gathering of technocrats. At this election, a large number of former public servants have thrown their hats into the ring, as well as a number of candidates from the private sector.
There has not been a woman elected to parliament since 2008 and Vanuatu is one of just three countries in the world not to have any women in its parliament (the other two – Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia – are also in the Pacific). This year around 15 women are contesting, including prominent human rights campaigner and former nurse, Anne Pakoa.
In Vanuatu, political parties tend to come together around personalities or family and kinship allegiances rather than political ideology. There is no left/right or conservative/progressive divide as such and different parties’ policy platforms often look very similar.
A contentious issue at this year’s election is the future of Vanuatu’s lucrative but controversial citizenship by investment, or “passport sales” programmes. These schemes have allowed applicants to become citizens in months, without setting foot in the country, for a price of around $US150,000.
The Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper found that 1,800 passports were sold in 2018 alone, making passport sales the single largest source of revenue for the Vanuatu government.
But away from the city, people are likely to vote for those they think will be able to meet their immediate needs, says Linda Kenni, a development consultant in Vanuatu who works in rural parts of the country.
“Some people vote because of the party… some vote for material things. They want to vote for people who will think of them when they win with material things like food items, solar lights and saucepans,” she says.
At the last election, voter turnout was 57%, and there are concerns that people’s fears of Covid-19, of which there have bene no confirmed cases in Vanuatu so far, will present an additional hurdle to overcome.
The director-general of the ministry of internal affairs has urged people to vote and said there will be hand sanitiser at polling stations in an effort to provide some reassurance to people who might otherwise stay away.
Once the elections are done, it will likely be a few weeks before there is certainty about what the leadership of Vanuatu will look like.
Whoever takes the reins will have a number of challenges to address including dealing with the immediate and longer-term impacts of the new coronavirus, about which there is huge fear across the entire Pacific region, determining whether big events such as independence celebrations and the Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting can proceed and the future of the nation."

'Nothing less than a catastrophe': Venice left high and dry by coronavirus
",John Brunton,"As destinations around the world face unprecedented challenges, we ask local people working in tourism in Venice how they are coping 


Tue 17 Mar 2020 14.14 GMT


Last modified on Tue 17 Mar 2020 15.44 GMT


Few destinations in the world are as closely tied to tourism as Venice. Last year the city ramped up measures to deal with the impact of over-tourism, until the unprecedented acqua alta  flooding in November brought the Unesco-listed city to its knees. The financial repercussions of the flood reminded everyone that tourism of some kind is still vital to keep this unique city afloat. Then the coronavirus crisis arrived, initially cutting short the February Carnival, which traditionally kicks off the tourist season. Now, along with the rest of Italy, the entire city is in lockdown, with restaurants and bars shuttered, hotels closed, flights and international trains suspended. With no tourists left in town, what do Venetians whose livelihoods rely on tourism think the future holds for them?
Mario di Martino, a well-known promoter of contemporary art exhibitions, is anxious but quietly confident “With all museums and temporary exhibitions closed, my work has obviously disappeared completely, which is difficult financially, he said. “But I think the Biennale of Architecture has made a good decision to postpone its opening from May until August, hopefully to give some time for things to get back to normal before people begin to reconsider visiting Venice again. Planning art shows always begins months in advance anyway, and with the important heritage Venice has as an artistic and cultural city, I do not think we will be abandoned by people.”
For independent tour guide Stacy Gibboni, there are more immediate problems, like paying the rent on 1 April. “Venice for me was always the perfect city, a place where I can earn sufficient money to live as a tour guide, leaving me plenty of free time to follow my real passion of being a painter,” she said. “But now my work has disappeared, with no future bookings to take tourists round, especially with the travel ban, as I work a great deal with American visitors. For sure, tourists will return to Venice in the long term, but I cannot count on when that will happen, so I am having to look at other means of earning my livelihood.”
The future seems even more uncertain for Gloria Astolfo, who creates handmade jewellery using Murano glass. “I initially closed my workshop and boutique, both right by Piazza San Marco, for the health concerns of my employees, who come into work by bus from Mestre and were terrified about the coronavirus,” she recounted. “Because we are registered as artisans, there is a special fund that will pay most of their wages for three months but, frankly, I may well be out of business by then with all the bills and rent I have to pay. So I have told them to already start thinking about other employment. I am pretty sure this crisis will last a lot longer than people think, and that afterwards people will simply not want to travel again for a long time. And my business, like all of Venice, relies wholly on tourism, so it is nothing less than a catastrophe.”
The peak could be as late as mid-May here, and as other countries are being affected later, it makes the outlook worse
Those running restaurants and hotels are trying to remain positive. Raffaele Alajmo runs the historic and opulent Caffè Quadri on on Saint Mark’s Square, along with his brother Massimiliano, a Michelin-starred star chef. “If you ask me about the future, I can only say I have absolutely no idea,” he said. “I think here in Italy we are doing our best, following the sensible instructions of our government to stay home to try to contain the virus, while obviously sustaining serious financial losses. Together with our restaurants in Paris and Morocco, we employ 220 people, and we are determined not to lose any of them, but it is difficult to know what to think when each country is reacting differently to this crisis. I do believe, though, that as soon as travel restrictions are lifted – whenever that may be – travellers will quickly return to Venice.”
The Perkhofer family have been running their landmark Hotel Gabrielli for four generations, and Francesca Perkhofer was philosophical about current events. “We’d already decided to close our hotel for a year in December, after the acqua alta disaster, to reinvest and repair damage from the flooding. So all our clients know we will not reopen for some time,” she said. “Even though we have now had to suspend the renovations because of the coronavirus restrictions, I continue to have faith in the future of tourism in Venice. For companies operating in the tourism sector, the outlook is clearly very tough. We have government forms to fill in asking to postpone payments for rents, bank loans, refuse collection– to give everyone some time to breathe. But the season is lost, and we do not know how long it will last. The peak could be as late as mid-May for Italy, and the fact that other European countries like Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands are being affected later than us makes the outlook for tourism even worse.
“Even if we get investment loans, they have to be repaid,” said Perkhofer. “I am curious to see how the situation will improve after corona. It will take a while before trust in safe travelling returns. Will everybody rush to recover lost turnover at all costs? Or will we all think and learn– how we can improve the quality of worldwide tourism and cut down excessive travelling? For Venice, I am more than confident that we will get back to normal very soon. This unique city is so beautiful, so special, that tourists will come back quite soon, and we are already working on marketing programmes to protect the future for Venice.”
That will all be too late for Roberto Meneghetti, a retired osteria owner who supplements his income by renting out a holiday home to tourists. “With no tourists and no future bookings, I have simply closed up the apartment,” he said regretfully. “And once all this blows over, I will have to put it on the market to recoup my investment. But I am a Venetian and will never leave Venice, because despite all these problems, I could never live anywhere else.”"

There is no ideal time for a pandemic, but fewer countries are less equipped to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak than crisis-ridden Venezuela, warn doctors and public health experts.
Bed shortages, a lack of isolation areas and short supplies of soap are already a daily reality at one hospital in Ciudad Guayana, a city in the country’s east. There is a nearby centre set up for the pandemic response but workers there say there are not enough ambulances to ferry patients.
“We are experts in crisis,” one health worker said. “But the coronavirus is a whole other challenge and we’ll need much more support.”
Cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, reached 33 in Venezuela on Monday evening, following the first two confirmed cases three days earlier. The government responded with a quarantine in the capital, Caracas, and six other states, alongside travel bans. On Monday the regulation was extended to the whole country.
But the outbreak could hardly come at a worse time for Venezuela, which despite boasting the planet’s largest proven oil reserves remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant – Venezuela’s central bank said inflation reached nearly 10,000% last year – while shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies are routine.
Hospitals regularly face power outages, while basic supplies – from latex gloves to basic antibiotics – are often hard to come by. Four and a half million people have fled Venezuela, with healthcare workers and disease specialists among them. Treatable diseases such as diphtheria, measles and malaria continue to spread in fertile conditions.
“The health system is completely weakened and without the capability or resources to respond to people’s basic needs – let alone an epidemiological situation like Covid-19,” said José Félix Oletta, who served as Venezuela’s health minister from 1997 to 1999.
A survey of doctors across the country carried out by the local NGO Médicos Unidos found that only 25% of respondents had reliable running water in their hospitals and clinics. Two-thirds said they did not have gloves, masks, soap, goggles or scrubs.
At the University Hospital of Caracas 80% of health workers are without protective equipment to treat patients who could be contagious. “The stretcher bearer should wear a face mask, a disposable gown and gloves; the orderly who collects the waste must wear glasses and gloves – but none of that exists at the moment,” said Mauro Zambrano, a representative of the Union of Hospital and Clinic Workers.
On Monday workers in at least two hospitals in Caracas were resorting to making their own masks from items that had been donated. “We are looking for solutions,” Zambrano said. Hospitals across the country have started online campaigns to bring in supplies.
Few know for certain how broken the health system is, owing to the opacity of the administration of the embattled president, Nicolás Maduro. The most recent epidemiological survey carried out by his health ministry was published in 2016.
“When forces close to Maduro censor information, it is difficult to tell people what they need to know – it’s difficult to respond,” said José Manuel Olivares, an opposition politician and doctor. “Actions taken by Maduro to hurt the health system have made it a sad fact that the coronavirus pandemic will cause more deaths in Venezuela and the region.”
Maduro, the leftwing successor to Hugo Chávez, is resisting a challenge to his legitimacy from Juan Guaidó, an opposition leader backed by the US and 50 other countries. The incumbent retains the key support of the military and remains allied with Russia, China and Cuba. It is unclear how the international community will respond to the outbreak in Venezuela, or which leader it would be prepared to work with.
Maduro, announcing flight bans in response to the pandemic, said US sanctions were hurting his administration’s ability to buy medicines and foodstuffs.
Feliciano Reyna, who runs an NGO in Caracas that distributes medications to those who cannot get them otherwise, predicts that the isolation measures announced by the Maduro government will also be hampered by the crisis. “When trash isn’t collected, or there is no water to wash your hands, isolation at home can become unsanitary,” Reyna said. “We are not at all well prepared.”"

How Australia will enforce coronavirus self-isolation rules for overseas arrivals

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Australia has introduced mandatory 14-day self-isolation for people arriving from overseas. But how will this be enforced?
Under the NSW Public Health Act, anyone who enters Australia from another country will be subject to a 14-day self-isolation quarantine, with fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ prison if they do not comply.
“Obviously the NSW government – indeed all governments around the country – are not wanting to impose penalties on people,” health minister Brad Hazzard said. “What we’re looking for is cooperation.”
The order banning mass gatherings of more than 500 people to stem the spread of coronavirus has also been made under the Public Health Act, with fines of up to $55,000 for corporations who breach that ban and $27,500 for each additional day the event continues.
The order explicitly excludes gatherings including the ordinary operation of a school, university, Tafe and educational college; the ordinary conduct of a court; public transport; and employees attending a workplace. It will remain in place until 14 June.
The Victorian government enacted a four-week state of emergency under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008, extending from 12pm Monday to midnight 13 April unless extended.
The state of emergency declaration gives authorised officers, such as police, at the direction of the chief health officer, the power to detain people, restrict movement, prevent entry to premises or provide “any other direction an [authorised officer] considers reasonable to protect public health”.
Under the directive signed by the chief health officer, it is an offence for a person arriving from overseas to fail to go into self-isolation for 14 days. People must not leave the premises where they are self-isolating except for the purpose of obtaining medical care or supplies; in any other emergency situation; or in circumstances where it is possible to avoid close contact with other persons. They also cannot allow visitors into their home.
The penalty for failing to comply is a fine of almost $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for companies.
“We don’t anticipate having to be fining people,” Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said on Monday. “To this point people have been cooperative.”
Flight attendants and citizens or permanent residents of a Pacific Island are exempt.
The same directive bans mass gatherings of more than 500 people, exempting schools, airports, public transport, markets, workplaces, courts, prisons and youth justice facilities, parliament and public places where people are moving through, such as Bourke Street Mall and Federation Square.
Andrews said the powers could be extended to include the lockdown of whole suburbs.
People arriving in Queensland from overseas will be issued with a notice requesting them to voluntarily self-isolate for 14 days. If they breach that notice, the Queensland government says it will “initially work closely with the person to ensure they not only understand their obligations, but also the importance and seriousness of self-quarantine under the current global circumstances”.
If that fails, the notice is enforceable under the Public Health Act 2005 with fines of up to $13,345.
Queensland has been in a state of emergency since late January and can use those powers to enforce compliance if necessary – but it has repeatedly stated that it is aiming for willing community cooperation.
The ACT declared a public health emergency on Monday in response to Covid-19, which gives the chief health officer powers to enforce quarantine provisions, to order the evacuations of public areas, to restrict access to an area, and even to force someone to undergo medical examination.
Under those powers, anyone who breaches the order for travellers to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Australia could face a $8,000 fine, under the Public Health Act 1997.
Mass gatherings will be policed under the same legislation.
Western Australian invoked powers under the Emergency Management Act at midnight on Sunday to enforce self-isolation requirements.
Under the act, travellers who breach the 14-day self-isolation order are liable for a $50,000 fine or possible jail time.
The ban against mass gatherings is enforced under the same legislation, with the same penalty to apply.
Self-isolation requirements will be enforced under the Notifiable Diseases Act, which carries penalties of $1,256 or six months’ prison for breaching a public health order.
Di Stevens, the acting chief health officer, said she expected the community would monitor and police each other to ensure isolation orders were followed.
Mass gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned under the Public and Environmental Health Act.
That does not include schools, universities, public transport or attending the Darwin markets, chief minister Michael Gunner said.
Travel to remote communities for everyone but essential services, supply runs and maintenance runs has also been banned. Gunner said people in remote communities were not being “left alone” during the coronavirus outbreak and would have everything they needed to be healthy and safe.
“To protect you, we are keeping nonessential people away from you,” he said. “If you don’t need to travel out of your community, then don’t. Just like the rest of us you are safer in your home community.”
South Australia declared a public health emergency on Sunday. Premier Steven Marshall told AAP the declaration would allow public health officers to take “all the necessary actions required to keep the people of South Australia as safe as we possibly can”.
The SA parliament this month passed new laws giving public health officers greater powers to order a person to self-isolate, be detained in a particular place or agree to medical testing.
Failure to comply with orders under the revised Public Health Act 2011 carries a maximum fine of $25,000.
Tasmania was the first state to ban cruise ships from coming into port, and introduced measures banning mass gatherings of more than 500 people, and requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days, from midnight on Sunday.
Under the Public Health Act in Tasmania, the maximum fine for breaching an order to self-isolate is $8,400.
The ban on mass gatherings does not include markets, like Hobart’s Salamanca market, on the justification that those events involve people moving through and are therefore unlikely to result in someone having sustained close contact with a stranger. However school fetes and assemblies have been banned."

How will coronavirus affect Australia's real estate market and house prices?
",Nigel Stapledon for the Conversation,"It will lose momentum and there could be falls. But it will be a short, sharp shock


Mon 16 Mar 2020 04.19 GMT


It’s one of the most googled questions since the Covid-19 outbreak began: how will coronavirus affect house prices?
The bottom line is it will be negative – prices will go down. People, up until now, have been talking about the property market developing a bit of momentum, with the interest rate cuts we had last year and the easing of credit conditions.
But coronavirus has changed the story for 2020.
The Reserve Bank cut rates soon after news broke of the developing coronavirus outbreak. On its own, that’s positive for the housing market (meaning prices stabilise or go up).
But the reason the bank is cutting is coronavirus is negatively impacting the economy as a whole – there’s no escaping that fact. Yes, the government has released its stimulus package and there may be more fiscal stimulus on the way, but there are limits to what any government can do. There will be negative effects on employment. It will be a short, sharp shock to the economy.
I fully expect a strong rebound by 2021 but, in the short term, it will hurt. There are sectors of the economy where people will lose jobs and it’s fair to say coronavirus is generating uncertainty more broadly in the community and, in turn, in the economy.
In the housing market the bottom line is there will be a pullback by buyers and that will take momentum out of the market, and we could see some price falls.
You can also look at what it’s done to other asset prices. Yes, interest rates are lower but other assets, notably equities, are being hit.
For a lot of people with wealth tied up in the share market, their wealth has been diminished. So capacity for many people to use that wealth to buy into the housing market has been reduced.
In this environment, buyers who are in very secure jobs are actually in an improved position because the overall market is weaker. Coronavirus will take out a group of buyers – those adopting a wait-and-see approach or those simply unable to buy due to reduced income.
But there’s another group of buyers: those who are in jobs but who face uncertainty about how coronavirus will affect their pay or whether they will keep their job at all.
Many of these types of buyers will be taken out of the housing market for now.
If you’re a seller, you need to appreciate that things are going to be weaker. Those would-be sellers who have flexibility will be able to defer and that could cushion prices falls.
There will still be people who need to sell for whatever reason. The turnover will decline but there will still be properties coming into the market.
The market has been getting more difficult for the investor. The market in, for example, Sydney is oversupplied at the moment and there’s already been some downward pressure on rents. Yes, investors can benefit somewhat from the decline in rates but that benefit is offset by declining rents.
Then, along comes coronavirus.
The weakness it is causing in the economy will accentuate the downward pressure on rents in the short term and that’s something investors need to be cognisant of.
If prices come down, investors could be in a better position to buy (to create or add to an existing property portfolio) but that weakness in rents is a real factor – it has been for some time and is unlikely to go away any time soon.
From state to state, each of the markets is doing slightly different things but the broad point applies across all markets. Coronavirus is everywhere. Its impacts on the property market will be everywhere too.
The Western Australian market has been weak for some time, and rents have fallen fairly drastically for quite a while now. There appear to be signs it could be stabilising but coronavirus won’t encourage that.
The Melbourne market has been strong and the vacancy rates aren’t as high, but there’s no doubt coronavirus will increase caution among many buyers and encourage a lot of sellers to defer.
2020 will, in many ways, be a hard year for the economy. Talk of a recession is growing and, while the big companies may not lay off a lot of people, a lot of small businesses are facing the prospect of low to no revenue. They may have no choice.
The financial capacity of small and medium-sized business will be harshly affected. If you’re a restaurant and nobody is coming in, you may have no option but to reduce staff or close. The stimulus package is well targeted but there’s no stimulus package in the world that could stop some of these effects happening.
The RBA has talked about a rebound in the second half of this year. Hopefully it’s right but I expect it at least by 2021. Either way, it’s important to remember the rebound will happen.
People will recover. People will go back to restaurants. People will go to football games. Things will eventually bounce back. Things will go back to normal eventually – but there will be some business casualties along the way.

Australian share prices are collapsing in afternoon trade, with the benchmark ASX200 index down 6.25% at around 2.45pm.
At these levels, Tuesday’s extraordinary 5.8% gain is set to be wiped out.
Buy-now-pay-later outfit and former market darling Afterpay has been smashed to smithereens, with its share price imploding by almost a third to make it by far the biggest loser of the day so far.
It has been falling since the beginning of the coronavirus panic; shares that were changing hands at more than $40 in the middle of last month are now worth just $13.07.
All sectors except utilities have been punished today, with consumer discretionary stocks – that means things like department stores and gambling – down the most.

We have no more information than that, at this point.
But the attorney general’s point about people who have not received welfare assistance previously and may be suddenly needing some kind of help is very interesting. And it doesn’t look like whatever happens, it will be a cheque-is-in-the-mail-style stimulus:
Now, when you talk about cash, what we have said, I think fairly consistently since the beginning of this, is that the individuals we have a very deep, broad welfare system, which is a proven delivery mechanism to get people through hard times. 
Now how we might modify that welfare system for these particular and extraordinary challenges is obviously something that’s being worked on. 
But already in the first round of stimulus we’ve dealt with this issue of the pause with respect to say for instance business. 
So business being able to get in, in the first wave of the direct fiscal economic stimulus payments based on the amount of withholding tax they keep for their employees, which is a good proxy measure for the number of people they employ – of up to 25,000 – is going to allow that business if it has a downturn in demand to keep people engaged with the business, even though they’re doing less work, and get through that six months so that they can surge out the other side of it when things get better, and when things get better they’re likely to get, you know, better fairly quickly.

Christian Porter also mentioned this:
The central issue is having identified people who will need assistance, what’s the best, most efficient delivery mechanism to give that assistance? 
And with the employment issues, I mean, very, very sadly it’s going to mean for a period of time over the next six months that people who have never had any contact whatsoever with the welfare system perhaps for the entirety of their lives, will be needing of assistance from the taxpayer. 
And in fact these who up until this point have been paying the taxes that keeps the system able to offer assistance. 
So, you know, it is extraordinary, these are unprecedented times in many ways, but not issues that we’re unprepared for, they’re being dealt with quickly, but in a very orderly fashion and based on all the best evidence and data that we can get in.

Christian Porter spoke to Perth radio 6PR a little earlier today. The transcript has just come out.
He has a bit more on this switch we are seeing from “stimulus” to “safety net”.
Well I would describe the round one measures as being sort of traditional fiscal stimulus. 
I mean they were things designed to keep businesses ticking along even with reduced demand, which will be clearly the case in many sectors, I mean many sectors are going to have increased demand obviously, but traditional stimulus measures to keep the economy pushing through what will be a very challenging six months.
 What is now being considered, what I would describe more generally as safety net issues – so not so much in the nature of traditional economic stimulus designed to push the economy through a challenging time but to identify people who will be in need of assistance, whether they’re businesses or business sectors or obviously individuals and clearly we’re going to have some issues around unemployment. 
So we’re trying to look at the ways in which we can cater for what are our best estimates around the scale and depth and location of those sort of problems.

Football (soccer) is off, until at least the middle of next month. One of the Canberra clubs has put out this alert to members:
Football Federation of Australia (FFA) has announced a suspension of all football (soccer) activities until after Easter, Tuesday 14 April. 
This means there will be no training, games, meetings or any other football activities.
The decision comes as the latest in a series of measures being introduced by the FFA to combat the ongoing spread of COVID-19 following the announcement of its COVID-19 Guidelines yesterday and places the concerns, health and wellbeing of the Australian football and wider community as the highest priority.
While we are all keen to get out on the pitch and get the season underway, we must consider the health risk that the spread of the virus poses to players and their families. 
Slowing the spread of the virus is the most important thing to do now and the only way we are likely to get any chance of a season of football in 2020.

From the Dan Andrews press conference, there was also an AFL update:
The AFL is doing everything the chief health officer has asked of them. I think that’s good. 
The ghost game issue, the no crowds, that makes perfect sense. Ultimately decisions for that code, for that league, for that professional sport is a matter for those who govern it. 
It won’t be the last discussion I have with Gill [McLachlan, the AFL’s CEO]. Footy is very important, not just culturally, but as an identity thing for us, particularly as Victorians. 
It’s a big employer as well. We’ll continue to speak with the AFL.
Those matters are principally for them, and beyond that, what I’m pleased to be able to report, they’re following the advice. 
They’re doing the right thing, to listen and engage with the chief health officer, to get that advice and act with an abundance of caution. 
I think that’s really clear and AFL are doing everything the chief health officer and experts are asking of them.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has released its wishlist for the second tranche of stimulus.
It’s quite a list. They want:
Some of these measures will be highly controversial – particularly the idea of freezing the minimum wage by calling off the annual review.
The ACCI has suggested that the government’s plan to support sick workers through the sickness allowance needs to go further.
ACCI said on this point:
“Many employees will have sick leave entitlements or carers leave to deal with children and family members needing care. However, the use of personal leave for isolation without illness is limited, some employees may not yet have accrued paid personal leave, some will have utilised their entitlement, and some casuals have effectively been paid in advance for such leave through an additional pay loading. In such situations there may not be a backup income where someone cannot work, although this is far from a problem with, or restricted to, casual employment. 
Two urgent measures suggested are:

It comes a day after the mountainous country closed its borders to all foreigners.

Staying with financial matters, we’re in for another extremely volatile day on world stock markets if the current situation in Asia Pacific is anything to go by.
The ASX200 in Sydney has taken yet another battering today, shedding nearly 5% with around an hour to go before the close. It’s a bit better in Japan (perhaps helped by Fujifilm) where the market is up 0.7%. Then we’re up in Shanghai but down in Hong Kong and Seoul.
But more significantly, the US futures market is pointing to another bad day on Wall Street despite Tuesday’s mini rally on Wall Street and on Europe’s beleaguered bourses.
The Dow Jones is set to open down 4% later on and the S&P is showing a drop of nearly 5%. 
These are massive falls. 
The problem, as identified by most market professionals, is that the US Federal Reserve can splurge all the money it wants but it can’t make a vaccine and the only thing that is going to reverse the downward trend of the markets is a flattening of the global – but especially US – infection rates.
Trihn Nguyen, Asia economist at Naxitis bank in Hong Kong, puts it very pithily:
Three limitations to the Fed: a) can’t cure the virus b) limited to supply of $$ & we still got credit squeeze & so more help on the operational side vs blanket rates; c) burned most of the wood when GDP was positive.

This is Martin Farrer taking over the blog for a short time while Helen has a much-deserved break.
We’re keen to inject a bit of optimism into the blog when possible and there is some in a Reuters story about how shares in Fujifilm have jumpped 15% after a Chinese official said the Japanese company’s Avigan anti-flu drug appeared to help coronavirus patients recover. 
Fujifilm is obviously best known for its camera equipment but one of its subsidiaries makes a drug called Avigan, which is also known as Favipiravir. The drug was approved for use in Japan in 2014. 
Reuters says that Zhang Xinmin, an official at China’s science and technology ministry, told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that Favipiravir has been effective, with no obvious side-effects, in helping coronavirus patients recover, 
A Fujifilm spokeswoman said the company had no comment on the Chinese government’s announcement. Fujifilm manufactures Avigan only on receiving orders from the Japanese government and has no sales target for the drug, she said. Fujifilm shares closed the morning up 14.7% at 5,207 yen, having briefly hit their daily limit high of 5,238 yen.

The pet dog in Hong Kong which grabbed attention after it tested positive for Covid-19 has died after returning home to its owner.
The dog was taken into quarantine in February when its owner was diagnosed with Covid-19. 
It returned a “weak positive” result over the course of several tests. Hong Kong radio reported this morning that the dog had finally tested negative and was allowed to go home on Saturday. However the owner told officials on Monday that it had died. 
Authorities did not say how the dog had died and the owner refused permission for an autopsy.
The dog never showed symptoms or appeared ill, and a blood test showed it had no antibodies. 
Health authorities repeatedly said there was no evidence the dog could pass the disease on to a human, and they urged people to continue to care for their pets. Because the dog showed weak positive results from swabs of its nasal cavity, the concern was that the cavity was likely a contaminated surface.

In US election news - and some context for that alarming potential unemployment figure given by US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin earlier: 
“This Democratic race isn’t pining for the fjords. It is no more. It has ceased to be. Its metabolic processes are now history. This is an ex-presidential contest.
The only reason the news networks could not call the Florida primary as soon as the votes piled up for Joe Biden was because the state’s panhandle voters were still at the polls. Once those polls closed, the obvious was made official: it was a blowout for Biden.
The last time we heard from Bernie Sanders after losing big in the last round of primaries, he said he wanted to debate the former vice-president head-to-head, one-on-one, to press his case directly and finally.
The only topic the American people want to debate is the coronavirus pandemic and the severe recession that looks like the certain outcome of this quasi-national quarantine. Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could hit 20% if they didn’t push through a huge economic stimulus as soon as possible.
To put that into context, unemployment peaked at 10% after the financial collapse of 2008. It hit 24.9% in the Great Depression in 1933.

In recent days, there has been an easing of restrictions in some parts of the province, with China saying it has “basically curbed” the spread of the virus.

Thousands of foreign travellers need to leave the northern Philippines by Friday or they will be stranded in the region, which has been placed under quarantine because of a growing number of coronavirus infections, officials said Tuesday.
President Rodrigo Duterte declared an enhanced community quarantine on the main island of Luzon that requires millions of people to stay mostly at home and restricts land, air and sea travel to fight the Covid-19 disease. 
The drastic moves announced by Duterte on Monday night, which include the suspension of mass transport, caught many by surprise and sparked traffic jams and confusion in many areas. Hundreds of taxis were stopped by police along metropolitan Manilas main EDSA highway for violating the transport ban and made to wait for hours in long rows on the sidelines. Many drivers said they were unaware of the ban and were eventually allowed to leave without fines.
The Philippines has reported 187 cases of infections, according to the Department of Health, which confirmed Tuesday that one of its officials was among those infected. Fourteen people have died, the highest toll in Southeast Asia.Transport Undersecretary Raul del Rosario said foreign tourists and travelers can opt to leave Luzon, where Manila is located, within 72 hours to avoid being stranded, because all flights from the region will be suspended.When the deadline arrives, they will have no option because all flights, domestic and international, will be canceled, del Rosario told a news conference.Many passengers jammed Manilas main airport Tuesday. Some airlines have already canceled flights, complicating the problems of outbound travellers."

Scott Morrison has told Australians to “stop hoarding” as he announces sweeping new measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, a global do-not-travel order, and strict new rules for visiting aged care homes.
In a massive step-up of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, the prime minister announced that a national cabinet of state and federal leaders had agreed on Tuesday night to an indefinite new ban on indoor groups of 100 people or more, with exemptions for schools, public transport, universities, prisons, courts, supermarkets and worksites.
The new measure, to be effective immediately, comes after a ban on mass gatherings of more than 500 people was put in place on Monday, prompting the widespread cancellation of sporting and cultural events.
While declaring a national human biosecurity emergency under the Biosecurity Act on Tuesday morning, Morrison ruled out an Italian-style national lockdown and urged calm, taking aim at those panic buying, saying it was “un-Australian” and unnecessary.
“Stop hoarding,” he said. “I can’t be more blunt about it. Stop it. It is not sensible, it is not helpful and it has been one of the most disappointing things I have seen in Australian behaviour in response to this crisis.
“That is not who we are as a people. It is not necessary. It is not something that people should be doing.”
The declaration under the act, which was signed off by the governor general on Tuesday morning, allows a minister to “determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary” to prevent entry or spread of a disease, with penalties for non-compliance.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has also announced level-four restrictions for all global travel, with formal advice now escalated to “do not travel overseas”, along with a call for Australians abroad to return home or risk being stranded.
Warning that the measures were likely to be in place for at least six months, Morrison stridently defended the government’s decision to keep schools open, saying that 30% of the health workforce could be disrupted if schools were shut, and jobs would be lost, with limited health benefits.
“The disruption that would occur from the closure of schools around this country, make no mistake, would be severe,” Morrison said.
“What do I mean by severe? Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more. [There would be] a 30% impact on the availability of health workers is our advice – that will put peoples’ lives at risk.”
“There is a national public interest here in keeping schools open and our advice is that is not being done at the detriment at the health of any child.”
He also said he would be sending his children to school and was happy to do so.
“There is only one reason your kids shouldn’t be going to school and that is if they are unwell,” he said.
The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, also emphasised that the virus behaved differently among young people, but said schools would still need to encourage hand-washing, practise social distancing and limit group gatherings.
“It will be hard for schools, but it would be much, much, much harder for society if the schools were closed.”
The national cabinet has also agreed to a range of restrictions on aged care home visits, including by those who have been overseas or exposed to the virus, those who have any respiratory illness or display symptoms, and school groups.
There will also be limits on social gatherings for aged care residents, and social distancing measures will be put in place.
For end-of-life situations, Morrison said arrangements would be made on a case-by-case basis, in negotiation with care facilities.
“In cases of end of life, I know that people will want to see their elderly parents or relatives or others. I totally understand that. Aged care facilities will have the discretion to put in very strict arrangements to enable people to visit their loved ones if that is the situation that that resident finds themselves in.”
Amid concern about the potential of the virus to take hold in vulnerable remote Indigenous communities, Morrison said a list of proscribed areas that would limit visitation was also being prepared by the states.
Anzac Day events and ceremonies will also be cancelled due to the higher proportion of older Australians who attend such events.
Ruling out a short-term lockdown of the country, which Murphy claimed would “achieve nothing”, Morrison warned that the measures being taken by the government would likely be in place for at least half a year.
“We are looking at a situation of at least six months for how we deal with this,” Morrison said. “It could be much longer than that. It could be shorter. That is unlikely, given the way we are seeing events unfold.”
“What we are doing, you have to be able to keep doing that and sustain that, that has to be something that is achievable for all Australians so we can keep our country running in the best possible way in the interests of all Australians.”
With 454 confirmed cases now in Australia, Murphy said the government was unsure of the current trajectory, but said there was now low-level “community transition” that would see the number of cases rise.
He emphasised the importance of social distancing and hand hygiene, urging Australians to “keep away from each other where possible”.
“No more hand shaking. No more hugging … no more scant attention to hand hygiene.”
Along with the health measures, Morrison said the government was finalising a second economic assistance package which would be focused on improving the “safety net” for affected businesses and individuals.
“The government is considering quite extensively further economic measures that will deal with the strength and the strengthening of our safety net and cushioning the even greater impact of the coronavirus on the Australian economy,” Morrison said.
“Last week we focused very much on the stimulus-type activity, encouraging investment, encouraging demand into the economy and providing support to small business. The measures that we are focusing on now are of a different nature – they are focused more on the cushioning impact of the safety net for individuals and small businesses.”
The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the opposition was inclined to support the economic stimulus package when it came before parliament next week.
“We will be supportive, make no mistake, of economic stimulus,” Albanese said.
But he said there was “urgency” to roll out health and economic measures as soon as possible, and called for more assistance for the aviation industry on top of a $715m package outlined on Wednesday.
“We know that the sooner the response, the more effective it will be and the less the cost will be in the long run,” he said."

Argentina registered its highest single-day rise in reported coronavirus cases so far Tuesday, with 14 new cases – 12 corresponding to recent arrivals from abroad – bringing the total to 79. Two deaths have been reported so far.
Grappling to deal with the crisis, Argentina has gone into full lockdown, leaving thousands of Argentinians stranded abroad. The latest estimate is that there are 30,000 nationals struggling to return to the country due to the suspension of incoming flights. Authorities are negotiating special flights with international carriers and putting the national carrier Aerolíneas Argentinas into high gear.Authorities are also working to stem the sudden flow of thousands of people to Argentina’s Atlantic beach resorts. The announcement of paid work leave for persons over 60 and permission for others to work from home has apparently been taken by many as an extension of the southern hemisphere summer holidays.
“We don’t want you to come, there’s an international situation and the protocols for isolation and quarantine have to be respected,” tweeted the mayor of Pinamar, a major beach resort.
Highway controls and the cancellation of all long-distance flights, trains and buses will start Friday, as Argentina heads for a long weekend.

She went into self-isolation after feeling feverish, before being confirmed as a positive case.
“All passengers who came in the same flight or in contact with the confirmed case will be traced and undergo isolation,” the minister said.
Samateh’s announcement came straight on the heels of a televised statement from President Adama Barrow, who announced anti-virus measures on Tuesday before The Gambia had a single confirmed case.
The president announced a ban on public gatherings and the closure of schools for three weeks from Wednesday.
Travellers from affected countries will also be isolated for two weeks, the president said.

Still in Australia: 
Victorian state police have warned drivers that they can lose their licence or be fined if they refuse a breath test over coronavirus fears.
Queensland police announced on Monday that it had immediately and until further notice suspended “static” roadside breath and drug tests — that’s when you round a corner and suddenly find yourself in a queue of cars being tested — to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Random single-car breath and drug tests will continue.
Victoria has taken the same approach — suspended the use of the big drug/0.05 bus but continued to do single car stops.
And in a statement on Wednesday, Victoria Police said drivers could not refuse a breath test out of coronavirus fears.

The Australian market slipped back 1.85% at the opening bell after the country’s government announced a relief package for airlines and amid increasingly gloomy economic forecasts.
Flag carrier Qantas plunged 7.34% while challenger airline Virgin Australia, which had been the focus of market speculation about its financial viability, soared 12.7%. Regional airline Rex, which this morning revealed its own financial weakness, dived 6%.
In a report, ratings agency S&P said that “the 2020 global recession is here and now”, slashing growth forecasts for economies around the world.
Before the exchange opened, more companies revealed the damage they were taking from the virus outbreak.
Air New Zealand shares have been suspended until at least Friday while the company works out the hit it will take from sweeping Kiwi travel bans.
The Australian government gave that country’s airlines a package of tax and service charge cuts worth $715m this morning amid widespread uncertainty about their ability to continue given travel bans and the end of corporate travel. Rex said that without help it would close in six months. It published a wish-list of relief that on first glance looks very similar to the government package.
SkyCity, which operates casinos in New Zealand and Adelaide, said poker machine revenue was down 14% and revenue from table games had plunged 43%.

","For some, workplaces are hotspots. For the over-65s, it’s shops and restaurants. We urgently need to change our behaviour
Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.
Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for diseases like Sars, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness – it is easy to recognise people who are infected.
In the case of Covid-19, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why airport screening at arrival is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, containment has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.
So how does an epidemic spread through a population – and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as R), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.
The larger the value of R, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to 1.4 new infections. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the early stages of an outbreak. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.
In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce R below 1. For diseases such as measles, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on R. For R of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for R of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get R below 1.
However, an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.
Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.
Another option to reduce the duration of infection is continued testing; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).
If we can’t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds with hot water and soap, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick – all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.
Cancelling large gatherings, working from home and school closures are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.
But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called BBC Pandemic, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.
What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 – who are particularly at risk from severe Covid-19 illness – make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.
Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number R, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.
We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it. Starting now, and for the duration of this epidemic, we all have a role to play and a responsibility to modify our behaviour in order to protect the ones who are most at risk.

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.
The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.
No. In the UK, the medical advice is now that the household of anyone who develops a new persistent cough or high temperature should all stay at home for 14 days, keeping away from other people. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.
You should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.
China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. There is now extensive human to human transmission across the world.
As of 15 March, more than 182,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have been over 7,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 79,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.
We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.
Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected."

From midnight on Sunday 15 March, everyone entering Australia from overseas, except for flight attendants and residents of the Pacific Islands, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Failing to do so risks thousands in fines.
But what does self-isolation actually mean, and can you still Uber home from the airport? We answered your burning questions.
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, indicated that people subject to self-isolation would still be able to take taxis and public transport from airports.
People who need to travel domestically after arriving in Australia will be able to continue their journey, beginning self-isolate when they arrive at their destination, according to Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton.
It’s important to maintain hygiene measures while in transit. Use hand sanitiser and cough into your elbow or into a tissue, and maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other passengers where possible. If you are a recently returned traveller in New South Wales, you must wear a surgical mask while travelling to your home or hotel.
The safest way to get home from the airport is for someone you live with to pick you up. If you have to take an Uber or a taxi, it’s worth sitting in the back seat and keeping a note of the vehicle number or the driver.
Taxi and Uber drivers should be taking extra precautions too, said Chris Moy, the South Australian president of the Australian Medical Association. He recommends drivers use hand sanitiser and disinfectant.
Travellers from the Pacific Islands are who are transiting through Australia are currently exempt from the 14-day self-isolation requirement in both Australia and New Zealand.
This exemption is explicitly mentioned in the Victorian state of emergency declaration.
That is because many Pacific Island nations are only accessible via Australia and New Zealand. There have also been very few cases of Covid-19 in the Pacific.
This depends. If you have been diagnosed with Covid-19, anyone you live with will be classed as a close contact so all of you will need to self-isolate.
If you are only self-isolating as a precaution, for example because you have just returned from overseas, they do not need to self-isolate – but you should stay as far away from them as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible. Ensure everyone in the home washes their hands frequently, and surfaces and doorknobs are frequently wiped with an alcohol-based disinfectant. Try to stay at least 1.5 metres away from the other people in your home. You cannot have visitors.
It’s recommended you stay away from people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus, including elderly relatives, and minimise contact with other people, including children. If you are experiencing symptoms, wear a mask or a makeshift mask.
Moy said that people needing to look after children or parents while in self-isolation should maintain good hygiene practices and minimise contact. Try to keep a 1.5-metre distance when possible, wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, and disinfect surfaces.
“To expect hard and fast rules is difficult,” he said. “We’re asking for patience, commonsense and probably a level of ingenuity from the public to get us through this.”
Each state and territory has slightly different laws around self-isolating, but if you are under a mandatory order to self-isolate it’s best to avoid going outside for anything but medical appointments and emergencies. Wear a mask when outside.
The Australian government’s health advice recommends exercise DVDs or walking around your backyard.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from Australian National University, says the thing to keep in mind is your proximity to other people – which means a walk alone, at a quiet time of day, should be fine.
The situation may be different if you are under a legislative order, in which case you will have to abide by the rules set down in each state.
If you are self-isolating because you have returned from overseas or have had contact with a known case, and you begin to notice respiratory symptoms (particularly fever, shortness of breath or a cough), contact your state or territory health department, your GP or the emergency clinic of your local hospital. Call before attending your GP or hospital to warn them you may have the virus.
If you have severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, call triple zero.
You will not be able to get a test unless you fit certain high-risk criteria and have respiratory symptoms. The Australian government is not testing asymptomatic people and at this stage testing remains restricted to people returning from overseas and known contacts of confirmed cases. If you have symptoms of pneumonia you will be tested regardless of travel or contact history.
Ask a neighbour, family member or friend to deliver groceries to you. These should be left outside your door. The same goes for grocery deliveries and takeaway food.
The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said government care packages will be made available to people in that state . “In the event, through no fault of your own, you’ve found yourself at home without the basics, we will get those basics to you,” he said.
Some community groups are also organising to provide food and supplies to people in isolation. If you have a neighbourhood Facebook group, check with them.
People who arrived in Australia before the mandatory 14-day self-isolation began at 12.01am on 16 March are not legally required to self-isolate, but they should still exercise caution.
The incubation period for Covid-19 is between five and 10 days. That means if you returned from overseas in the past two weeks, particularly from countries with a high rate of spread, such as the US, you should be engaging in social distancing, and monitoring yourself for any symptoms.
Collignon says the higher your risk of experiencing complications from the virus, the more distancing and hygiene measures you should be putting in place.
“For people in the high-risk group, particularly people over 70, once we get a lot of transmission in society, relative self-isolation is a good idea,” he said.
“You don’t become a hermit, but you limit your contact to people who are well, and to fewer people.”
The rate at which people should be increasing their isolation should rise with the spread of the disease, Collignon says. So while a healthy 50-year-old person may be social distancing now, once the weather cools in winter and the spread of the virus increases throughout the community, they may need to self-isolate.
Self-isolation for 14 days is mandatory for anyone who arrived in Australia after 12.01am, 16 March and financial penalties apply.
